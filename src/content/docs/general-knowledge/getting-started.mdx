## How to get better
If you are reading this chapter, then congratulations, you pretty much know what the discord server it has to offer.

However, some of you joined the server to learn how to get better at playing IS. Dumping all the resources and calling it a day would be irresponsible of us, nor would it be constructive to promote high-level IS gameplay in the EN server.  As the saying goes, “Give a man a fin and you feed him for a day; teach a man to fin-catch and you feed him for a lifetime.” This entire section will be dedicated to going over some of the important mechanics of IS, starting from a basic down to the advanced level. Having a strong fundamental understanding of all these mechanics is imperative to winning consistently. If this is not what you are interested in, you can turn back after reading at least the next section.

Good habits/General tips
Here are some quick general tips which may be helpful. Some of these are general uncategorized advice to get better, while others are good habits to get used to.
- Go through/knowing all collectibles before entering a stage
- Going in with a plan on clear the stage, regardless if it is a stage you cleared many times, or its a stage you never cleared before
- Check conditional difficulties (Hallucinations/Call of We Many/Collapsal Paradigms/Epochs) and plan accordingly to them
- Do not be afraid to take risks. IS gameplay is balanced around high risk high reward. Worst case you return back to Floor 1 and learn something new.
- Record/stream your runs and ask for feedback from experienced players.

## Choosing a starter
This section aims to aid players who are looking for a strong starting operator without any preferential bias. While the writers of this guide acknowledge that certain starting operators and squads are stronger and more meta than others, we by no means discourage readers to deviate from their preferred starts, nor do we force readers to conform to a defined meta.
This guide will not be listing out certain operators that are strong in each IS theme for a variety of reasons.
- The list is too long to be fully inclusive (definitely not being lazy here)
- The meta shifts with IS expansions. Certain starting operators that are strong pre-expansion may not transition well post-expansion
- Players are biased towards certain operators depending on their gameplay style
- Some starters require corresponding starting squads to function. For example, some operators gain a huge power spike after being promoted and starting them unpromoted is unviable.

First we must address the elephant in the room. Why does picking a strong start matter? The answer is quite simple. In the earlier floors, it is unlikely that you would have a lot of operators available because there just isn’t enough vouchers available at the given moment to get more operators, even if they are reserve operators (being a throwaway body also counts as a role). More operators means more roles in a squad are fulfilled.

Here we will post some general criteria that a strong starter normally fulfills:
1. Gaining economy fast through obtaining stage resources
    This criterion is somewhat self-explanatory. Winning at IS is closely tied to snowballing early, the earlier the floor the better. How does one snowball? By being rich in resources of course! Maybe you got a chest here, killed the duck lord there, streaked flawlessly through the entirety of floors 1-3 as well. These little things could make a big difference. Maybe that two ingots you got is the difference between buying HR letter on the floor 1 shop or skipping it. Maybe the duck lord gave an old fan as a reward. Maybe the shields you got from your flawless streak early on meant you could pass emergency Out of Control with a sliver of lifepoints to spare. There is no telling what butterfly effect those early resources could do in the late game.

    Here are some possible stage resources that are relevant and a strong starter should help you to accumulate:
    <ol type="a">
        <li>Earning money by breaking chests</li>
        <li>Earning plans by breaking spines in IS5</li>
        <li>Obtaining relics by killing animals on early maps</li>
        <li>Saving lifepoints and shields by performing leakless clears on early maps as a solo carry</li>
    </ol>

2. Saving hope (more in the economy section) 
    <ol type="a">
    <li>Being both relevant in early and late game</li>
    <li>Covering multiple roles in a team</li>
    </ol>

## Economy

Is IS all about beating stages? The answer is no. Given a bad squad, it doesn’t matter how skilled the player is, a hard stage will cause a run to lose. Likewise, with a good squad and relics, the chances to clear a hard stage improves massively. So the question then becomes how do we avoid being in a situation with a bad squad. The solution is to have a good economy. The term “economy” is quoted amongst most IS players often. We define economy as the decisions to accumulate resources and bolster your run outside a combat stage.

## Voucher Environment
When playing IS, you might notice a pattern where every time you clear a stage, sometimes there is only one voucher to choose from. In other stages, you may get to pick one voucher from two options. In fact, the number of vouchers that a stage allows you to choose from after beating a stage is not random. The IS community generally coins these different subsets of floors that give the same number of voucher choices as voucher environments.

Below is a table of the number of voucher choices for each floor for each IS for combats

| Floor   | IS2 | IS3 | IS4 | IS5 |
|---------|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| Floor 1 | 1   | 1   | 1   | 1   |
| Floor 2 | 1   | 1   | 1   | 1   |
| Floor 3 | 2   | 2   | 2   | 1-2 |
| Floor 4 | 1   | 1   | 1   | 2   |
| Floor 5 | 2   | 2   | 2   | 2-3 |
| Floor 6 | 2   | 2   | 2   | 2-3 |
| Floor 7 | -   | -   | 2   | -   |

A general trend is that early floors have fewer voucher choices than later floors. The threshold point between having one choice versus having more choices occurs mostly on floor 3

Having more voucher choices is great because there is a greater chance to find vouchers that you need. Maybe you are looking for a vanguard to fund your expensive units that are inflated by Commerce epoch, or you are looking for your medics especially if you start with a starting composition without a low rarity medic, or you are looking for your premium solution to Sentinel (aka degenbrecher).

Consider the hypothetical scenario where you have a bunch of hope and need to spend it to bolster squad power. Rather than spending it on the fly on early floors for suboptimal choices, it would seem reasonable based on the above conclusions to spend it on later floors for the increased chance of getting vouchers to flesh out your composition. More on how to design and draft a composition will be discussed later on.

Of course the actual circumstances may vary, one of the scenarios being if you are in desperate need of squad power and need something, maybe just anybody, to carry you through the next floor. We will discuss this scenario more later in the Tempo Picks section.

## Shields/Life Points
Are we perfect players? Hell no. Every player is prone to mistakes. If you are aiming for a perfect clear of a story stage outside of IS, there is minimal cost to resetting and attempting the stage again. However, in most cases, quitting an IS stage means losing the run. Unless you are playing relicless, most of the conditions that you experience when doing a stage differs every run. Given that we are not perfect players, a safety net would be appreciated, maybe just some room for error. In some maps, the ability to choose to leak certain problematic enemies will make the map half as hard. That’s where shields and lifepoints come in. A known IS pro once said this quote that the writer agrees thoroughly: “Lifepoints are the most useless resource, until you need it the most.”

What is the difference between shields and lifepoints?
When a stage is entered, the sum of shields and lifepoints become your total lifepoints that can be lost on a map. However, there are distinctions between the two. The distinctions differ for each IS so we will dive deeper into each IS individually.
### IS2
One of the major distinctions between IS2 and the other IS themes is that there is no max lifepoints. Max lifepoints is defined as the maximum number of lifepoints that can be accumulated. Meanwhile, shields are a renewable resource of free lifepoints that refresh every stage. In other words, if you have one shield, you can leak one enemy for free per stage.
### IS3 and IS4
IS3 and IS4 begin to introduce the concept of max lifepoints and shields that we are more familiar with today, as well as the concept of “shield-stacking”. Above a certain threshold of lifepoints, every perfect clear naturally leveling up your command level does not get to this threshold early on. This is why many would grant one shield as a reward. Getting to this threshold is not easy. Good IS players value max lifepoint collectibles so they can reach this threshold on earlier floors to allow them more combats to streak their shield bonus. This can mean the difference between getting to the boss with few shields versus having enough shields and lifepoints combined to leak not only one, but two bosses. The feeling of safety that abundant shields can give is unfathomable.
### IS5
IS5 removed the shield-stacking mechanic unfortunately and players start their run with less lifepoints. However, the main non-collectible reliant method of obtaining shields is through fusing inspires. This mechanic will be elaborated more on specific IS pages later. Nonetheless, IS5 further emphasizes the point that lifepoints and shields are a resource which are valuable only when you need them the most, which is usually when you encounter a hard stage or make a mistake.

## Pathing
### Node value
Regardless of each theme of IS, one thing has not changed. Each map is structured into nodes and paths that link nodes together. The types of nodes are extremely varied and it would be silly to assume that the value of each node is the same. The value of the node can be thought of as the resources that your run can gain in order to maximize the chances of your run. Ideally, the resource yield of these nodes have low variance and are not detrimental.

Here is a quick summary of some nodes that are shared amongst IS themes and their corresponding value, assuming the conditions of a normal IS run (and in the case of nodes which require risks or a sufficient amount of development like Emergency combats, that you can safely clear the node.):

| Node              | Significance                                                                                                                                     | Value                 |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| Normal combat     | Main source of command experience and ingots<br />Source for recruitment vouchers<br />Chance for collectible drop                                   | Medium to High        |
| Emergency combat  | Even better rewards compared to normal combats<br />High risk, high reward<br />Extra guaranteed collectible                                         | Very High             |
| Rogue trader      | Guaranteed 4 voucher choices including refresh<br />Choice of impactful collectibles<br />Value significantly tied to ingot count, the more the better | Medium to Very High   |
| Scout             | Removes one operator temporarily for the rest of the floor, to return promoted start of the next floor<br />Aim to promote higher rarity operators to maximize value<br />Saves a voucher, promotion hope cost, and yields other rewards depending on IS theme | Medium to High        |
| Safe house        | Choice of one out of three given options, with a total of 5–6 possible options<br />Good place to hunt for promotion vouchers, vertical pathing resources or squad size<br />Value is tied to how many desirable options can be offered | Medium                |
| Lost and found    | Exchanges a collectible or foldartal for another<br />The exchanged collectible rarity depends on the rarity of the offered collectible<br />Main purpose is to either obtain ending conditions or to exchange detrimental collectibles | Low                   |
| Downtime recreation | Gamble away your resources for other resources<br />Very RNG dependent. Unstable resource yield, with some options being detrimental as well       | Low                   |
| Encounter         | Dominated with non-combat events with a small number of combat encounters<br />Also somewhat unstable resource yield compared to regular combats<br />Some encounters are related to endings | Low                   |
| Wish fulfilled    | Choice of one collectible amongst a number of options                                                                                            | Low                   |


Pathing is arguably one if not the most important and hardest aspect in IS to master. In the simplest terms, an optimal route would path through the most number of high-value nodes possible. However, this greedy routing has flaws. The first being that vertical paths exist, which are explained in the next section. Choosing when to and when not to take these paths is not immediately obvious. The other flaw is that more experienced players would like to complete endings that are not the default ending. Obtaining these endings requires pathing into certain nodes to obtain ending items. Hence for these players the “value” of these ending nodes are higher. More on the strategy of pathing will be explained in a separate guide.

### Node generation
A number of dedicated players have taken a significant number of samples of IS maps and generalized rules for the map structure of each floor on each IS. In essence, they manage to decode the node generation logic of the game. These generalized rules are helpful for pathing. Knowing which floors certain desirable nodes are more likely to appear means maximizing your success at hunting for these nodes at the ideal floor. Node generation will be explained in a separate guide as well.

### Vertical paths
#### Why are vertical paths important?
Without going through any vertical paths, the number of nodes that you pass through the floor is equal to the minimal distance between the starting position of the floor and the end of the floor. Going vertically essentially increases the number of nodes that one can traverse before ending the floor, which increases the resources that you can obtain before advancing either to the next floor where harder stages exist or to tackle the boss at the end of the floor.

#### When should I take a vertical path?

Going vertically doesn’t come for free. Ever since IS3 where vertical paths are introduced, the advent of a new resource called keys unlocks the potential to pass vertically. In IS4 and IS5 they are called anti-interference indexes and plans respectively. Usually if there is no reason to hoard these resources to go vertically for other purposes, going vertically usually results in better economy. Here are a number of reasons why going vertically should be reconsidered:
1. Saving a key for entering the Wonderland node in IS3
2. “Going blind” on the next floor in IS4, because anti-interference index is tied to vision
3. Saving plans for reaching ending nodes in IS5
4. Pathing into low-value nodes
5. Your development in the current floor is enough to tackle the stages on the next floor. This is because the combat yield at higher floors is generally better.

### Wonderland/Bosky/Possibility

#### Why are these nodes important?

These nodes are essentially “mini-floors” containing a small number of nodes. Entering such a node places you into such “mini-floors” and reaching the end of the “mini-floor” brings you back to where you left off at the original floor. Similar to going vertically, going into a bosky increases the number of nodes past before reaching the end of the floor. However, instead of just a single node for going vertically, entering these “mini-floors” gives multiple nodes for the price of going vertically or less. This is a reason why the value of these nodes are so high, since they compress the value of multiple nodes into a single node. For the purposes of the Scout node, entering a mini-floor is considered entering a new floor. For the purposes of squad effects that give you some resources on each floor, some of these squad effects proc when entering these mini-floors.

However, the risks of going into a “mini-floor” are great. Tougher stages with tricky conditions may be encountered when entering these nodes. Here is a quick tabulated summary of what can be encountered in these mini-floors and their associated risks.

| IS theme                  | IS3 (Wonderland)                                  | IS4 (Bosky)                                               | IS5 (Possibility)                                                                 |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Type of nodes              | Combat, Wish fulfilled and a boss fight          | Combats and Non-combats                                   | Combats, Face-offs and Wish fulfilled                                             |
| Risks                      | Tackling a random boss unprepared<br />Encountering combat stages that appear on higher floors | Combat conditions that alter/hamper the way stages are played | Combat conditions similar to IS4 but are also stackable across possibilities traversed |
| Example of possible risks  | Tackling a dp intensive boss fight (Gravestone) without a vanguard | Doing stages with 2 deploy limit<br />Defeating enemies with buffed defensive stats | Doing stages with reduced ally and enemy attack<br />Doing stages with melee operators frozen on deployment |


## Hope
The currency of hope was already introduced early in the tutorial for IS. It is an expendable resource combined with vouchers to recruit and promote operators. Hope is surprisingly a scarce resource and should be managed wisely. While there are external sources of hope such as collectibles, the main method to obtain hope is to accumulate command experience and level up. Below is a quick non-inclusive ranking of hope gain sources from highest to lowest
1. Command level up (more in the later sections)
2. Collectibles
3. Scouting operators in IS5 (passive way to save hope)
4. Gambling in downtime recreation

### Leveling up
Successfully clearing a combat rewards combat experience, which can be used to level up. Excess combat experience will contribute towards the next level. Levelling up rewards hope, squad size and squad size. Below is a tabulated summary of the hope gained after reaching a specific command level.

| Level \ IS theme | IS2 | IS3 | IS4 | IS5 |
|------------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| 2 | 4 (4) | 4 (4) | 4 (4) | 4 (4) |
| 3 | 4 (8) | 4 (8) | 4 (8) | 4 (8) |
| 4 | 5 (13) | 5 (13) | 5 (13) | 5 (13) |
| 5 | 6 (19) | 6 (19) | 6 (19) | 5 (18) |
| 6 | 6 (25) | 6 (25) | 6 (25) | 6 (24) |
| 7 | 6 (31) | 6 (31) | 6 (31) | 6 (30) |
| 8 | 7 (38) | 7 (38) | 7 (38) | 6 (36) |
| 9 | 8 (46) | 8 (46) | 8 (46) | 6 (42) |
| 10 | 8 (54) | 8 (54) | 8 (54) | 8 (50) |
| 11 (PO squad) | | 15 (69) | | |

*Note: PO squad is short for People-Oriented Squad in IS3*


A quick glance would show that the amount of hope gained after reaching a new command level increases with higher command level. In conjunction, the command experience required to reach a new level also increases as well.

Below is a table compiled by DieAlive on the command experience yield on each floor in IS5 as an example.


| Stage (IS5) | Experience yield |
|-------|------------------|
| F1 normal stage | 13 |
| F1 emergency stage | 15 |
| F2 normal stage | 15 |
| F2 emergency stage | 23 |
| F3 normal stage | 17 |
| F3 emergency stage | 33 |
| F4 normal stage | 19 |
| F4 emergency stage | 39 |
| F5 normal stage | 26 |
| F5 emergency stage | 47 |
| F6 normal stage | 26 |
| F6 emergency stage | 47 |

One can observe that the combat experience increases the higher the floor the stage normally appears on. A floor 5 stage showing up on floor 4 would yield the experience of a floor 5 stage. Emergency versions of the stage generally yield more command experience than their normal counterparts, which is aligned to the general principle of “greater risk, greater reward”. Later floor emergencies tend to give disproportionately more command experience than their normal counterparts (in comparison to earlier floor emergencies.) Given a choice to do a normal stage versus an emergency stage, if there is no certain risk of losing the run or other circumstances, it is generally a good idea to tackle an emergency stage for the better rewards.

Some collectibles give increased or decreased command experience yield for clearing combat stages. These modifiers stack multiplicatively. Having increased command experience yield is great for early game progression as you would be able to benefit from the resource yield from levelling up command level at an earlier point in the game

### Hope planning
From the previous section we established that levelling up is a very significant source of hope gain. However, this source is non-renewable. Once you reach level 10, the level cap is reached and no more hope can be obtained by accumulating command experience. While there is an abundance of hope relics that exist in the game, it is not wise to rely on them given the fact that encountering these hope relics are RNG-dependent and have opportunity cost such as ingots. From a conservative standpoint, the total hope of your full team composition should not vastly exceed the maximum hope gained corresponding to the command level reached at the ending.

To illustrate this point, consider the hypothetical scenario where you are going for an ending 3 clear at IS3 or IS4. Assuming you are not avoiding combat nodes, reaching level 10 should be possible before the boss node. Hence your planned team composition ideally should not vastly exceed 54 hope, which is the total hope you would accumulate at level 10.

The exact circumstances change based on other factors such as obtaining free promotions through safe houses or scouts, or obtaining hope relics etc. Hope planning is a tricky topic and with more in-game experience and practice it should come intuitively.

#### How to plan hope around command level
Spending hope should be determined based on the current state of your command level. An easy way to plan hope on the fly is also to note how much hope you can gain in the short term. Let’s consider two hypothetical scenarios:

**Scenario 1:** <br />
For example, let’s say I’m playing IS4 and I already command level 9, it would be not wise to draft many 6* operators at this point because I only have 8 more hope to gain after reaching level 10. Otherwise, a newly drafted 6* in this scenario would have a chance to not be promoted. Moreover, chances are that you might already are at floor 6 which means that there are very few combats to get more vouchers to promote your newly drafted 6*

**Scenario 2:** <br />
For example, let’s say I’m playing IS4 with the Eternal Hunt squad. I have 2 hope, an E1 Myrtle, and I’m 1 combat away from command level 4. I complete a combat and receive a vanguard voucher.

If I am desperately looking for another 6 star, I should not promote Myrtle here as tempting as it might be, because after this combat I’d be at 2-1+5=6 hope, which is not enough for a 6 star, meaning that most vouchers I could receive would be dead vouchers.

On the other hand, if I had 3 E1 6 stars that really want promotion to E2, then I would be more likely to take the Myrtle upgrade, since right now even if I go to 6 hope after the next combat, there’s a good chance that I’ll get a relevant voucher, such as one that lets me promote an E1 6 star etc..

### Drafts
The strategy for planning a team composition and drafting the composition is complex. There are at least two schools of thought that are not mutually exclusive to achieve this. However, the first step always starts with having a plan before going in. Starting an IS run willy-nilly and drafting operators just because they look pretty would most likely crash and burn really quickly, and ideally we want to avoid that.

### Roles
**Core Composition** <br />
Due to limited hope constraints from what we mentioned previously in the hope section, your composition must be affordable. The first school of thought is to design what is known as a core composition. A core composition is a group of 3-4 operators which fulfill the following criteria:
They should be able to solve most non-boss stages together
They should play some role in boss stages
They do not have to be synergistic, but they should cover the weaknesses of each other
Most meta compositions fulfill these criteria, and hence they are meta. However, these core compositions differ in each IS theme due to the nature of the stages. Hence directly copying a core that works in one IS theme into another often does not work.

Here is a composition that works in IS3 and how they fulfill the criteria


| **Operator** | **How do they solve non-boss stages** | **What role do they play in boss stages** | **How do they cover each other weaknesses** |
|---------------|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Kroos alter** | - Stun on talent to ground drifters<br />- Decent single target damage when buffed by Skadi alter | - Shuts down highmore boss fight when paired with Skadi alter S3 | - Drifters are troublesome to Mlynar due to them being able to use ranged attacks if left unstunned |
| **Skadi alter** | - Improves Kroos alter's damage to medium defence enemies<br />- Provide small amounts of sustain<br />- Large amounts of sustain on S1 to heal all units from stages with Pompeii | - Shuts down highmore boss fight when paired with Kroos alter S2 | - Kroos has very low attack and has no attack multipliers on her most commonly used S2 |
| **Mlynar** | - Provide high damage per hit multi-target output to solve large waves of enemies | - Clear jellyfish in Izumik fight, which have high defence | - Kroos alter's single target is not effective against mob waves or stages that have high defence enemies such as Ember Phalanx |
| **Yato alter** | - Clear up trash mobs<br />- Flexible option to solo high treat enemies that are hard to reach | - Block jellyfish and kill revealed mobs in Izumik fight when doing no-feed | - Clears up spike chests that can kill Mlynar due to her invincibility |

### Working backwards
The second school of thought is to work backwards from the boss stage. The boss stages are typically the hardest fights in the gamemode so we first want to find out what are the minimum operators/relics we need to clear the stage so that if we meet these conditions, the stage is doable consistently.

Notice that it was mentioned that the core composition is designed to clear most normal stages. While ideally the set of core operators can play some role in boss fights, boss stages are often mechanically heavy and much more complex than normal stages. Moreover, the core composition is limited to 3-4 operators. Drafting the core composition still leaves some hope left for other operators, which we could invest into operators who work specifically for boss stages. Some operators who may not perform exceptionally in normal stages can play pivotal roles in troublesome boss stages and hence warrant the hope cost and vouchers to draft them.

However, there is a big pitfall that is associated with this school of thought. The pitfall is that in order to reach the boss, you must be able to survive the entirety of early, mid and late game. It would be ridiculous to draft a whole bunch of ending responses that do absolutely nothing in a normal stage. Hence, a good ending response should at least be not entirely useless in normal stages such that the overall squad doesn’t feel too clunky to play.

![Speccast Players](/getting-started/speccast_players.png)

To flesh out this concept, here is a procedure that can be considered:
1. Look at the boss stages that you plan to tackle and consider the different working parts that make the stage hard.
2. Disassemble the working parts individually and think how certain operators can help solve each part, fulfilling a role.
3. Optimize the list of operators such that as few operators are needed and extend the scope to normal stages or other boss stages.

Let’s go through an example of how this process works:
1. Suppose we are planning to do ending 2 in IS4. Eikthynir, which is the boss on ending 2, has a number of tricky mechanics. Not only does he have the ability to freeze nearby targets, he enters an unblockable dashing state when damaged below a certain threshold.
2. One of the popular solutions for Eikthynir is to use a tank and a medic combination to stall the boss until all the enemies are cleared. This prevents Eikthynir from dashing prematurely,making the situation much easier. Focusing on the tank role, most ground operators with decent defence can fulfill that role.
3. The higher the defensive capabilities of the tank, the lower the investment into the healing role is required. This can be in the form of having either higher defence, or having passive sustain, or other sources of damage reduction. In this aspect, protector, duelist, some guardian and sentinel defenders can fulfill that role.
4. Comparing between defender options, Shu has the application to heal with her skills, which is valuable in the case where medic vouchers are scarce mid game. Her teleport skill also has a variety of applications. She renders Eikthynir’s dash useless, requiring less setup or investment into a levitator/crowd control option. Moreover, she has the ability to teleport Crazelyseon, the boss on ending 3, on the Sentinel fight. This extends the damage window possible for the fight. Hence Shu is one possible, if not the best, solution for Eikthynir.

### Overdrafting

![](/getting-started/handmixers.png)

Overdrafting is a common mistake made by both beginner and semi-experienced players. Overdrafting occurs when a new operator is drafted but the role that the new operator is meant to fulfill is already fulfilled by operators already in the squad. This is a sign of hope mismanagement and can be fatal.

One may argue: “But this new operator can do this job better than the original one!” While this statement is justifiable, one must consider the marginal improvement that the new operator can bring as opposed to the original one. An example would be a Nightingale draft to replace Ansel versus the same draft to replace Eyjafjalla the Hvit Aska. The former is justified as Ansel is a zero hope cost medic, hence having zero sunken cost, that is unlikely to function as an endgame medic, while the same cannot be said for the latter.

Overdrafting is very dangerous because drafting the new operator is essentially a hope sink. A command level up gives 5-8 hope in mid to end game, roughly equivalent to a 6* recruitment. Accumulating the amount of command experience to reach the next level requires several combats. Hence overdrafting could imply that for the next several combats any vouchers, especially the ones that you are looking to recruit core operators, are mostly voided because there is no hope to work with. Moreover, the hope cost of  recruiting a new operator, especially a 6, is typically several times higher than to promote an existing 6 operator. You could be forced into a situation where several important operators are locked out of their promotions or recruitment.

### Voucher Efficiency

Once you’ve planned out your drafts, you will want to look at the total number of vouchers you will need to get to complete your draft. For example, in IS3 your final planned draft might be something like Chen Alter, Kroos Alter, Skadi Alter, Shamare, Angelina, Kal'tsit, Mylnar, Yato Alter, Weedy. This is a fairly standard draft for someone planning to do Knight + Izumik in the same run. If we count the total number of vouchers per class we’d need, we’d have:

| Sniper | Supporter | Medic | Guard | Specialist |
|--------|-----------|-------|-------|-----------|
| 4 | 6 | 2 | 2 | 4 |

What immediately jumps out is that 6 supporter vouchers in total are needed to complete the squad! Over the course of an entire run it is not unreasonable to see 6 supporter vouchers, but what this means is that every opportunity you see one, you should almost always prioritize it. This also means that if you get a chance at a free promotion from a scout or relic, you should almost always use it on supporters. Now we can also see that Guard vouchers are also relatively low priority, since there’s only one guard that was planned to draft (Mylnar). As such you might put him lower on your priority list, in particular if you see a choice between a guard voucher and a voucher that you need more operators from.

There is however a notable exception. If an operator is critical to maintain consistency and survive the run, then obviously you should take them. For example, if you are at f3 and your squad is E2 kroos, E2 Shamare and E1 Kal’tsit and you are offered a Supporter and Medic voucher, taking the medic voucher to promote Kal’tsit is more important to improve your lacking squad power over taking Angelina or Skadi Alter. It is also important to note that being flexible in IS is extremely important. Sometimes vouchers simply won’t go your way, and as such it is important to recognize when it is time to plan for an alternate strat or take a tempo pick.

### Tempo and niche picks
Let us return to the scenario we addressed earlier where you desperately need a certain operator to fill a specific role in your squad, but the voucher drops are not ideal. In such a scenario, one should not only be flexible in terms of using these suboptimal vouchers, but to also be cognisant beforehand and reserve hope to combat this situation. Otherwise, there is no point in discussing drafting operators in an out of the box fashion when no hope is available.

Here are a number of scenarios to illustrate this point:
1. Suppose you are about to transition to floor 3 and your starter operator is not promoted. After evaluation of your current squad power, you determined that it is unlikely that your squad can survive a significant number of floor 3 normal stages due to a lack of damage. Rather than choosing to die on the next floor, you can consider what is known as a tempo pick. A tempo pick is an operator draft to bolster your damage output in order to lower the risk of dying in the short term and essentially not lose the run. This operator differs from a core composition pick in the aspect that they may not contribute to the late game or play a pivotal role to the boss fight.
2. Suppose you are on floor 4 at IS4 Defense versus Offense and your medic vouchers don’t exist. It is already somewhat of a miracle that you made it past floor 3 with no medics. One of the operators that you happened to raise is Quercus. Quercus is an abjurer supporter who has a healing skill that has infinite duration, essentially working as a medic but using supporter vouchers. Drafting Quercus would be a good idea to supplement your healing needs until you encounter a medic voucher for your end-game needs. This is a reason why a lot of IS players raise Quercus, just to combat scenarios like this.

There are many more scenarios that I would not list, but the above two are some common ones. It is imperative to diversify not only your raised roster of operators, but also to learn the kits of these operators, because they could save your run.


## Ingots
Ingots is another currency resource in IS. It can mainly be obtained by beating stages and the ingot chests within. Ingots are usually useless by themselves unless spent. One of the nodes where ingots can be spent is the rogue trader node (also known colloquially as a shop node). In the previous section on nodes, it was highlighted that the rogue trader node is a very high-value node. However, its value is directly tied to the number of ingots available. Typically the number of ingots that most pro players recommend to have to justify pathing into a rogue trader is at least 12 ingots.


### What should I spend in the shop?
One interesting fact about the shop is that in all IS themes before IS5, the first floor shop is different from shops on other floors in the aspect that the voucher options on the first floor shop is always one of three possible options even upon refreshing: medic, vanguard and caster.

The shop offers several types of items for sale. The typical non-floor 1 shop has two voucher options. Depending on the theme of the IS played, foldartals and thoughts are available for sale in IS4 and IS5 respectively. The rest are occupied by tactical equipment and collectibles. Upon entering the shop, it is a good idea to plan which items are worth buying and mentally calculate how much ingots are required to purchase them all. If a shop refresh is possible, some ingots should be saved for any high quality items that can show up in the second page of the shop post-refresh.

There are no concrete guidelines to determine which items ingots should be spent on.

**Vouchers**: Vouchers are the most valuable resource available from the shop. Each shop provides a total of four vouchers (except F1 shop), making shops the most efficient node in terms of voucher acquisition. Typically, if you are lacking in squad power or need important roles fulfilled, such as a vanguard or a medic, these vouchers take high priority.

**Damage Collectibles**: Determining how good collectibles can be is tricky. Generally speaking, collectibles which give hope are valuable and should be bought on early floors. For combat collectibles, a fundamental understanding of how operator and enemy stats are calculated, as well as specific breakpoints or kill thresholds is required. For example, a source of about +20% ATK (something like Bend Spears - Acuity would be sufficient) is necessary to let Degenbrecher 1 cycle Artillery Drones in F4 Emergency Restricted Zone. Due to the distribution of the pool of shop collectibles, it's often a little hard to buy direct, generically applicable combat power in the form of combat-relevant collectibles. Many of the combat-relevant collectibles the shop sells are specifically class specific collectibles such as the books that only affect one class. When shops do sell generically combat-relevant collectibles (for example: Flashing Swords in IS3, Rock Horn in IS4) or class-specific ones that apply to your important damage classes (for example: Sniper books for Sniper-Medic Squads), pay specific attention to them when deciding what to buy.

**Economy collectibles**: Some collectibles provide economy, such as squad size, deploy limit and hope. Planning ahead is necessary because any of these items in excess provides no value and is therefore a waste of ingots. Some collectibles ramp up the more certain nodes are traversed and are good to pick up early game but terrible at late game. There are very few relics that are always a must-buy.


### Investing

Since the beginning of IS2, the shop node allows you to invest ingots into a deposit bank. The balance in the bank can be withdrawn later. However, this is not the only benefit to investing. After reaching certain thresholds for the first time, permanent rewards can be unlocked.

# Cannot shop unlocks

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| More slots in the shop | More chances to find collectibles |
| Refresh shop items | The contents of the shop after rerolling are always different<br />More vouchers and choices for better collectibles |
| Shop rob | Turns the shop into a combat, gaining command experience<br />Gaining more ingots for attack speed ingot relics (IS5 exclusive)<br />After robbing, all items in the shop are free to pick up, giving a huge power boost |
| Ingot withdrawal | Able to buy pivotal collectibles or needed vouchers whilst not having enough ingots |
| Unlock exclusive collectibles | Cannot's mark is a great economy relic, offering large amounts of hope for few ingot cost |

#### Spending & Withdrawing
What happens if you encounter a rogue trader node and the items offered are so good that you want to buy most, or even all of them. However, your current ingot count says otherwise. The shop node offers a withdrawal feature that allows you to withdraw ingots from an investment balance. The more ingots are withdrawn, the more it deducts from the balance. Withdrawing habits depend on the player. Some players are very liberal at withdrawing, especially in casual runs, while others are very stingy. Here the writer suggests to invoke a limit to how much balance can be withdrawn per run, both as a self-regulatory tactic to promote better ingot management habits and as a simulation to tournament rules. To elaborate on the latter, many tournaments have withdrawal rules to limit how many ingots can be withdrawn per run to prevent certain players having an unfair advantage.


## Collectibles (written by Die Alive)
### Introduction
Collectibles are one of the most important factors in IS to improve the success rate of the run. Being able to identify what collectible is best to pick on a given situation will contribute to this. In order to know which collectible could benefit your squad better there are multiple factors to consider; such as knowing, throughout the run, what set of collectibles are essential to clear the endings and/or stages required and which are not, which collectibles would be more important earlier than later, and which collectibles boost your operator damage, hp, and reduce damage taken better, this section focuses on the last part.

### Stats calculations in IS
In arknights there are four main types of damage: Physical, Arts, True, and Elemental damage. Physical and Arts damage being the most common.

The following diagrams explain how the attack stats of an operator are carried out, including certain types of modifiers that can appear in IS.

![Attack calculation formula](/getting-started/attack-calc.png)


Base ATK: refers to the base attack of the operator, this is visible on the operator interface before starting a stage.

External modifiers: refers to any modifier that affects the given stat (ATK, HP, DEF) that cannot change within the stage, because of this reason it is easy to identify which collectibles could fall into this type of modifier. These stats are often determined immediately when the stage has begun and are generally visible on the operator interface before they are deployed. In this case we will be using ATK as an example. All IS have a skill tree which buffs all operators by a certain percentage, in IS5 for example this is an extra 30% (after DLC2) for Atk, Hp, and Def, and is considered as an external buff.

Internal modifiers: refers to any dynamic modifier that affects the given stat (ATK, HP, DEF) that can conditionally change within the stage. Operators’ skills that are generally denoted as “ATK +x%” are also considered as internal modifiers (Not to be confused with ATK Scale skills, denoted as dealing x% ATK). While most relics are represented this way, the rule of thumb is that if they cannot change given a certain condition within the stage, they are a external modifier instead. For example, Emperor’s Favor, which gives +15% ATK to melee units is a external modifier, since “melee” is an inherent attribute of operators that doesn’t depend on the stage. These modifiers are generally visible on the operator interface only after they are deployed.

Inspire: refers to the specific “Inspire” buff obtained from bards, such as Heidi and Skalter.

%Debuff: refers to percentage debuffs, often applied by certain enemies.

Final ATK: is the final attack value that will appear in the operator interface, from which the following calculations are based off.

![Damage calcuation formula](/getting-started/dmg-calc.png)

Atk Scale: refers to the multiplier in which some skills base their damage off, generally denoted as “dealing x% ATK as Physical/Arts damage”.

Def and Res: refer to the type of damage reduction applied according to the damage type. DEF is only applied to physical damage and is simply a subtraction, making high ATK values good when dealing physical damage. RES is only applied to arts damage and works as a damage percentage reduction, making arts damage generally bad when high Res values are present on enemies.

Damage modifiers: this encompasses multiple types of multipliers. Some can be of the same type, stacking additively while others can be of different types and stack multiplicatively. Examples of additively stacking modifiers would be Emperor’s Collection (+30% arts damage) and ‘Brilliant Lament’ (+40% arts damage) resulting in a $(1 + 0.3 + 0.4)$ multiplier instead of a $(1 + 0.3) \cdot (1 + 0.4)$, whereas Emperor’s Collection and Scout’s Scope (Damage taken increased based on distance up to 100%) would stack multiplicatively: $(1 + 0.3) \cdot (1 + 1)$ (assuming for Scope that the enemy at max distance of 6 tiles or higher).

True and elemental damage bypass Def, Res, and damage modifiers, making them really good options for certain situations where enemies are bloated in these stats.

In general, buffs within the same category (external buffs for example) stack additively, while most are applied multiplicatively with each other (external buffs with internal buffs), as explained in the previous diagrams.

While these calculations work for the damage an operator deals to an enemy, the same formulas are applied into an operator when they receive damage, with the addition of certain damage reduction buffs like sanctuary, physical damage reduction, arts damage reduction, and others, that are applied in the damage modifiers category.

#### Stats bloating

Understanding how these buffs interact with each other can help maximize damage given different collectibles options. As an example, let us work through the calculations for Surtr’s S3 damage buffed by two different types of sources, an external modifier attack buff from Rise and Fall (+30% ATK) and an interal buff from an E1 Warfarin on S2 (+60% ATK).

Naively, one would predict that the damage increase provided by Warfarin is larger than that provided by Rise and Fall by comparing the buff numbers. However, this is incorrect, as we will work out together.

Surtr has a base ATK of 800 outside of IS. First we factor in the stat buffs of 20% ATK provided by the fully expanded skill tree,
$\text{Surtr\_base\_atk} = 800 \cdot 1.2 = 960$.

![](/getting-started/surtr_1.jpg)
![](/getting-started/surtr_2.jpg)

After activating Surtr’s S3 and applying warfarin’s buff, Surtr’s final attack stat is found to be

![](/getting-started/surtr_3.jpg)
![](/getting-started/surtr_4.png)
![](/getting-started/surtr_5.png)

$\text{Surtr\_final\_atk} = 960 \cdot (1+3.3+0.6) = 4704$

Accounting for Surtr’s res ignore talent, the final damage dealt on a spine is
$\text{Dmg\_dealt} = 4704 \cdot (1-(0.5-0.22)) = 3387$

(Note: this calculation is done below D14 difficulty, at D14 and above, the spine would take half that damage since enemies within Mark of Epoch take 50% less physical and arts damage.
Next we consider the situation with Rise and Fall. With Rise and Fall, Surtr’s attack without the skill up becomes $\text{Surtr\_base\_atk} = 800 \cdot (1+0.2+0.3) = 1200$

![](/getting-started/surtr_6.png)
![](/getting-started/surtr_7.png)


Because Rise and Fall is an external modifier attack buff rather than an internal buff, it does not stack additively with the +330% ATK buff provided by Surtr’s skill. Instead, it stacks multiplicatively. Hence the final attack Surtr has after S3 is activated is $\text{Surtr\_final\_atk} = 1200 \cdot (1+3.3) = 5160$, which is higher than the result we got with E1 Warfarin.
Here is a summary of the calculations done:


| Base ATK | ATK with IS buff | ATK on S3 in IS | ATK on S3 with Warf in IS |
|----------|------------------|------------------|--------------------------|
| 800 | 960 | 4128 | 4704 |

| Base ATK | ATK with IS buff | ATK with IS buff + talons | ATK on S3 with talons in IS |
|----------|------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------|
| 800 | 960 | 1200 | 5160 |

The main reason why we get a counterintuitive result for which attack buff is better for Surtr for more damage is because Surtr gets so much internal +ATK% buff from her skill activation that the marginal +60% from Warfarin is severely washed out.

To conclude, diversifying your sources of buffs from skills and collectibles improves damage output the most. Moreover, when choosing which collectibles to improve your damage, maximizing the stat region that is the lowest is the best way to amplify your damage.



#### Attack speed
Another important part of dealing damage is the attack speed of the operator, or as referred to in game, attack interval. This stat is generally only available through external resources and can be modified by ASPD or as an attack interval modifier. ASPD is a percentage based increase, all operators have a base of 100 ASPD and any further increase is added to this, while the attack interval modifier is generally applied directly to the attack interval value before ASPD is applied, calculated as:

$$ \text{final\_attack\_interval} = 100 \cdot \frac{\text{attack\_interval}}{\text{attack\_speed}}$$

ASPD is bounded in a range between 20 and 600. If accounting for frame rounding then the real attack interval value would be:

$$ \text{real\_attack\_interval} = \frac{\text{round}(\text{final\_attack\_interval} \cdot 30)}{30}$$

*Note: round in this context means to clamp between 20 and 600*

#### Defensive collectibles
While offensive relics are generally important in order to finish a run successfully, often defensive relics can be really helpful or even required to deal with certain mechanics. The calculation for these is very similar to the Final Atk calculation, replacing Base Atk by the operator’s base defense or hp. A noticeable mention here is with Aegis (+60% max hp), while most hp relics are applied as an external buff, this one stands out for working as an internal buff, being multiplicative to all other stacked hp external buffs.

#### Enemy stats
While this covers how operator’s stats are calculated, enemy damage and defensive stats calculations can also be important to know in order to survive or understand how your operator’s damage or relics can start to fall off throughout a run as you progress through floors. Enemy attack and hp scale with both difficulty and floor as follows:

$$ \text{difficulty\_buff} = (1 + \frac{\text{difficulty\_scaling}}{100})^{\text{floor}}$$

The difficulty_scaling factor varies across IS and is stated as “Enemy Difficulty” when selecting the run difficulty. Here the floor acts as an exponent to the added value from the difficulty, this means on lower floors, apart from other external difficulty debuffs, the enemy stats might not feel very different from low difficulty runs, but as the run progresses this will become way more noticeable and make the need for more damage and survivability relics higher. Note that Wander into Wonderland/Bosky Passages/Possibility nodes in IS3/IS4/IS5 do not count toward the floor number for the purposes of enemy stat calculation. If you took a Bosky Passage earlier and are now on F3, the value of floor is 3, not 4.

Some difficulty levels also have specific +stat% increase modifiers from individual difficulty level effects. These effects are all multiplicative of each other. For example, the D11 + D15 effects in IS3 (Elites and bosses get +20% HP) and (Elites and bosses get +20% HP/ATK/DEF) stack multiplicatively, meaning they get a total of +44%.
Enemy stat multipliers from the effects of emergency versions of combat stages are multiplicative with other stat modifiers. If the emergency effect of an emergency stage provides two individual multipliers to the same stat, they are also multiplicative with each other. For example, Safety Inspection has the following emergency modifier: All enemy units have +20% ATK, +20% DEF and +30% Max HP
Additional 1 &lt;Sarkaz Maze Returner&gt; appears and all &lt;Sarkaz Maze Returner&gt; have additional +30% Max HP.
Sarkaz Maze Returners would get a net +69% HP effect to their HP.

Enemy stats are calculated slightly different than the operator stats, while similar buffs stack additively for an operator, for the enemy it is always multiplicative, even with similar relics such as Gold-Plated Die (-15% HP) and ‘Profound Silence’ (-20% HP), where these result in a $(1-0.15)\cdot(1-0.20)=0.68$ multiplier, stacking multiplicatively with the difficulty buff to the enemy base stats. Additionally, while defense does not stack with difficulty or floors, enemy defense relics are still applied in this way. Enemy hp down collectibles are particularly potent because killing weaker enemies due to them having less hp is equivalent to enemies taking an overall damage increase debuff. Having Profound Silence applied on enemies is equivalent to having a $\frac{1}{1-0.2} = 25\%$ overall damage increase to all your dps operators.

#### Other resources

Squad size and deployment limit are also very important resources to keep in mind. While they do not directly improve the damage or defensive capabilities of your operators, they are still important factors to consider during a run.

Squad size lets you bring more squad power into a stage. Some collectibles also scale with the number of certain operators in a squad, such as certain coop class books and the famous Old fan. The maximum squad size available is 13. One method to accumulate squad size is by naturally levelling up your Command level. However, this method only lets you get up to 9 or 10 squad size. Some amount of squad size either through Safe Houses or squad size collectibles would be ideal.

Having more deployment limit is mostly a quality of life improvement but quickly becomes a huge detriment if you do not have enough of it. Unlike squad size, increasing your command level does not grant more deployment limit. On high difficulties, the default number of deployment limit available is 6 for IS4 and IS5. This number is pretty tight for late game. The scary part is both IS4 and IS5 have combat conditions which greatly reduce your deployment limit. For example, redeployment boskies reduce your deployment limit by 4, while Congestion epochs reduce your deployment by 3. Playing with 2-3 deployment limit is extremely difficult, especially on floor 5 or boss stages. Generally having at least 1 or 2 extra deploy limit makes your life so much easier.

## Map familiarization

Map Familiarization
Combats are a fundamental portion of IS, and to the game in general, since this is a tower defense gacha game after all. Combats, both normal and emergency (EM) have higher value than most non-combat nodes, which we explained in a previous section. A brief summary of the reason is as such: combats are one of the main sources of ingots, vouchers and command experience. Moreover, clearing boss stages is a requirement to clearing endings and completing a successful run.
Quoting from Sun Zi, “If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles”. Knowing how each combat map works is important to successfully clearing combat stages. While experienced players can redirect newcomers to map resources mentioned previously, it is not intuitive how to convert enemy stats, enemy descriptions, timings and pathing into a working solution. Let us break down the situation step by step below:

### Map characterization
We begin by dividing maps into two non-mutually exclusive categories: Gimmick-heavy maps and Stat-check maps. Some maps are both gimmick-heavy and stat-check maps, and it is no surprise that those maps are usually the most difficult ones.

#### Gimmick-heavy maps
Gimmick-heavy maps are defined as maps where the enemies interact with the stage mechanics, thereby making the stage difficult. However, if you play around the mechanic in your favor, then the difficulty of the stage can drastically decrease. On the other hand, failing to respect the mechanics often gets you steamrolled, Here are some example stages and their corresponding mechanics to respect:

| Stage | Mechanic |
|-------|----------|
| The Earth Wakes (IS4) | Boss has fragile when exposed to environmental damage<br />Roadblocks for stage pathing |
| Musical Disaster (IS4) | Flux mechanic enables and disables enemy mechanics<br />Flux mechanic hampers SP gain of operators |
| EM Simulated Skirmish (IS5) | Londinium cannon targeting operators emphasizes stage opening |
| Witch-Curse Alliance (IS5) | Tune variation mechanic to disable |
| Guiltless Paradise (IS5) | Chapter 14 Originium pollution mechanics |


The general approach to tackle gimmick-heavy maps is to first understand how the key mechanic of the stage works. To find more about the key stage mechanic, stage and enemy descriptions in-game give good insight to this. Online resources such as PRTS CN wiki and tomimi.dev are also accurate sources of information. Then one can go about understanding how conventional approaches to the stage work and design their own strategies. This can be done by asking around in corresponding IS channels and looking up stage clears of different squads in is-resources threads on our Discord.

Let’s walk through an example of this approach with The Earth Wakes map in IS4
The Earth Wakes features a boss, Elder Vinecreeps.


![](/getting-started/elder_vinecreeps1.png)
![](/getting-started/elder_vinecreeps2.png)

Given that the boss can stun allies after performing several attacks, dealing with it face on would be a problem. Moreover, we could leverage the boss’s trait where it gains a large amount of Fragile after taking damage from environmental effects.

Let’s look at the map afterwards

![](/getting-started/the_earth_wakes1.png)
![](/getting-started/the_earth_wakes2.png)


The main enemies on this map are invisible snipers and casters. These enemies are usually not threatening by themselves. However, there are two Originium tiles on the map, which make these enemies much more deadly. The good thing is that the Originium tiles are classified as environmental damage. Another thing to note is that 5 roadblocks are available to modify the enemy pathing on the stage. We can use this to path the boss into the Originium tile so it takes more damage from our operators due to Fragile. Yet at the same time not let the other enemies path to the Originium tiles so they won’t destroy our units.

Now let’s look at a conventional box placement for this stage


![](/getting-started/the_earth_wakes3.png)
![](/getting-started/the_earth_wakes4.png)

The boxes are first used to guide the boss onto the Originium tile, then the last box is used to funnel the regular enemies and the boss into a path that is free of Originium tile influence. The same strategy can be applied similarly to the other spawn permutation of this map. Damage and healing operators shown here can also be similarly replaced with your squad.

#### stat-check maps
In comparison, stat-check maps are, as their name suggests, stat checks. You are going to struggle if damage or healing doesn’t meet the requirements of the stage. A common aspect of these maps is that while the mechanics of the stage might not be difficult or relevant, they make up for having bloated enemy stats with many waves of elite enemies. Eg: Instinct Contamination, Requested Enemies Obtained, Hollow Visage, EM March of the Dead


To succeed in IS, one should always take calculated risks. Part of determining these risks against stages like these is to have an accurate judgement of your squad strength. Do you have enough damage operators to clear all the waves of enemies? Do you have enough damage collectibles to defeat the key elite enemies on the stage? Is your healing enough to sustain the healing pressure from the enemy? After assessing these risks, it really just boils down to three options:
1. Tackle the stage, apply ally combat buffs if necessary
2. Leave the stage, either by taking another route or changing the note to another type
3. Leak troublesome enemies, capitalizing shield and lifepoints as resources

Let’s use EM March of the Dead as an example. Suppose I have the following operators:


![](/getting-started/em_march1.png)
![](/getting-started/em_march2.png)

Without any damage collectibles, dealing the Colossi is going to be very tricky. The typical strategy is to have Mlynar do two skill cycles on the Colossi. Ela will handle the casters and Dublinn Cannoneer Captains from the bottom lane. Degenbrecher will clean up some of the mobs when Mlynar skill is down. Any mistake causing the top lane to fall is going to cost a significant number of leaks especially with the Colossi covering for the Flamechaser Soldiers and Elite Guards. On paper this might be a tough cookie to crack.

![](/getting-started/bloodbath.png)



However, upon closer inspection of your collectibles, a collectible that you happen to have is Bend Spears-Bloodbath. This vastly improves Degenbrecher’s skill uptime, letting her contribute more damage to the Colossi. Moreover, her skill applies Frighten, a debuff which causes blocked enemies to be unable to perform auto-attacks. This opens up the option to stall the Colossi with her S2 as well as keeping Mlynar alive if he happens to block a Colossus. After assessing your collectibles, you come to the conclusion that your odds of clearing the stage leakless is much higher.


### Adapting to the situation
Nobody plays perfectly, even the best IS players out there, let alone you who are reading this guide right now. But what makes the best IS players the best is not only the ability to make perfect plays, but also to adapt to the situation on the fly. This could be by making unorthodox plays to combat certain adverse conditions, or salvaging a run when a mistake is made. In essence, discussing adapting to the situation can be divided into adapting before entering a stage and adapting after entering a stage.

#### Adapting after entering a stage
The main importance of learning to adapt within a stage is to salvage the impossible when a mistake is made. Here are some guidelines on how to do so:
1. Identify the instance when a mistake is made. Pause the game immediately. The earlier you identify when a mistake is made, the easier it is to react before it is too late.
2. Assess what resources are available to deploy to deal with the situation. The main resources are any backup or on-field operators as well as the DP to deploy and execute any actions to save the run
3. Slow down (pause/1x speed) your executions so that you have more time to think through any actions


#### Adapting before entering a stage
Some stages when comboed with certain conditional difficulties (Hallucinations/Call of We Many/Collapsal Paradigms/Epochs) can be extremely deadly. A general example would be facing stages with high opening pressure while having paradigms that impact your stage opening capabilities. A pessimistic and passive point of view would be to think that since IS is mainly RNG dependent, there is nothing that can be done when faced with what seems to be a dead end.

Yet the common saying goes “When life gives you lemons, make some lemonade”. There is never a moment when you should give up your run. If anything, beating an impossible run is material to post in the IS-general channel to show off. Moreover, the player is flexible and should take measures within their capabilities to either survive or avoid being in a detrimental scenario. This is tied deeply with your experience in IS.

An example would be when faced with March of the Dead with injury trigger, one could concord silence foldartals to summon shieldguards so vanguard operators can be deployed safely. Silence foldartal itself is a good foldartal to pick up just in case for this, and helps pass many max HP checks like Sentinel or Enter Eternity.


## Conclusion
And that’s it for the guide. Hopefully you picked up some tips from here to improve your IS gameplay. After reading all the tips and guidelines from here, the next step would be to apply what you learned into gameplay through practice. There is still plenty of content that is not covered, the majority of which are interactions in specific IS themes. These will be found in specific IS guides posted later.

I would like to thank especially Oyana for suggesting the guide to be written; DieAlive and Bait for writing sections of the guide that I do not feel qualified to write about; and the moderators of IS-central as well as the volunteers for putting in the time and effort to proofread and give feedback on the content and readability of this work.
