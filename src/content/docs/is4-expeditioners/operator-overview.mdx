## Foreword

This document was created with the purpose of helping newer players in efficiently drafting operators in IS4, with specifically D15 in mind. IS4 has a particularly grueling hope curve, especially for those playing Eternal Hunting squad as they forgo the discounted recruitment cost of Class squads. I considered creating a tier list for this, but I think tier lists are extremely bait. It is better for a player to understand why they are drafting something rather than taking it because someone’s list said it was S tier. For the purpose of clarity, whenever a skill and its numbers are mentioned, it will be under the assumption that it’s Mastery 3. The same applies to Modules unless stated otherwise. 

## General principles

The particular demands of IS4 maps influence what operators become meta in high difficulty. Even if you don't have a particular listed meta operator, think about how they respond to various situations, and what other operators you have that could fill their role. The meta developed for a reason, but it is not a hard requirement to participate at all.

Collectible synergy strongly influences how well operators perform. In every IS theme, physical damage generally sees more value than arts damage. This is because DEF is a flat damage reduction that can eventually be outscaled with enough collectibles, but RES is always the same percent reduction, regardless of how high you stack your attack. IS4 enemies also generally have fairly low DEF, making physical damage even stronger here. In IS4 the Empty Fowlbeast collectible (which boosts the stats of summons and their summoners) means operators who have some form of deployable device also gain more value. 

IS4 has many very fast enemies that make map openings tight, which can be made even worse by Barometric Anomaly gutting your natural DP gain or Injury Trigger damaging your operators the moment they deploy. This makes having a cheap unit who can either kill the opening wave alone or buy time to deploy more units incredibly important. Enemies in IS4 maps often come in crowded waves with significant downtime in between, so strong burst damage is also generally more valuable than more consistent DPS with lower peaks.

At higher difficulties, especially as the floors progress, the stats of already dangerous enemies like Shattered Champions increase so much that trying to block them becomes unfeasible. This means Defenders lose a lot of value in the long term, particularly the ones that don't do much other than blocking. Since blocking is a last resort and enemies are fast, crowd control options to keep enemies from running out of your units' range are highly valuable. 


## Drafting for Endings

In high difficulty IS, you’re meant to start drafting for the ending you’re going for as soon as possible, once your squad is strong enough to not explode to the stages on the later floors. "Drafting for endings” means taking a look at the boss’ mechanics for each ending and going “what operators can I use to counter this?” Operators who can hold lanes and do damage are a given, but you'll need more than that for each boss' gimmick. 

Bosses in IS4 can come in two variants on higher difficulties, and you don't know which one until you get there, so it's good to keep both versions in mind. Naturally, operators that can cover multiple roles in a fight or contribute to multiple bosses are more valuable picks. Here we'll go over some common ways to counter each boss' gimmicks.

### Lofty Silverfrost/Ice-Cold Image (A)

First thing you’ll notice about the map is that most of the tiles are locked down by ice that you have to remove before you can set up, meaning you need aoe burst damage that goes out fast and/or spreads far. In Lofty Silverfrost, this can be easily accomplished by for example Reed Alter S3 chain explosions. Yato Alter S3 also works well to clear a path to set up a melee AOE unit like Degenbrecher or Młynar in a good position to clear more ice. In Ice-Cold Image, the massively increased HP of the ice prevents Reed from getting a chain explosion going, but Yato, Młynar, and Degenbrecher remain good at the job. 

In Lofty Silverfrost, the boss has a mechanic that will stun one of your operators every so often, based on deployment order. Below 50% HP, this ability will target 2 operators instead. You’ll need two units to eat these stuns, and they'd better not be your medics or blockers. Młynar's passive taunt means the boss skill will target him regardless of when you deploy him, making him a good counter. You can also just bait this stun with a fast-redeploy operator and retreat them afterwards. In Ice-Cold Image, the boss doesn’t use this stun and instead applies the cold effect to all units (both friendly and hostile) on the field, making bait less important. 

It doesn’t matter too much who you use to DPS the boss, so long as they actually do damage. Młynar and Degen are popular choices for this role, but operators like Logos and Ray will also work (with support). Since the boss covers 3x3 tiles, Yato s3 also travels far on it.

### Ending 2: Sami’s Entropy/Hollow Visage (A)

Eikthyrnir’s boss mechanic is that when reaching certain HP thresholds, he will begin to sprint, cannot be blocked, and becomes immune to most forms of crowd control effects. The exceptions include Levitate, Fear, movement speed reduction (separate from Slow), and teleports. 

One strategy is to CC him every time he starts sprinting to limit how far he gets to run. Fear in particular is very effective, since it makes him turn around and not actually get any closer to your blue box, meaning Nymph is a good counter pick. Ascalon's S2 movement speed reduction is also so intense that Eik will not get very far before you can block him again. 

Another method is to block Eik and avoid damaging him until all the enemies in the stage are gone and you can focus all your damage on him. Someone like Shu is a perfect counter in this case: she can both block Eik by herself and use her S3 teleport to CC him once he starts running. You'll still need some way to unfreeze her long enough to use her skill while blocking him, some options include Ines' ASPD steal on S2 (only works without Non-Linear Action) or Degenbrecher's Frighten talent preventing him from attacking at all. Once Shu unfreezes, simply DPS Eik hard enough that he will begin to sprint before her skill runs out.

### Gardener/Sentinel (A)

Crazelyseon is a brutal Burst check, as you can’t damage the boss without activating the pylon in the middle of the map. The normal version gives you a 5-10 second interval to damage it (depending on how charged the pylon is), while the alternative version gives you 2.5-5 seconds to do it. The boss deals a lot of damage and is only vunlnerable for short windows of time, so the goal is to stack as much survivability as you can while buffing one or two burst damage operators to take down the boss. 

Degenbrecher is probably the most popular damage pick for this boss thanks to how concentrated her S3 damage is. Heidi, Warfarin, or Skadi Alter are highly recommended as buffers (any one of them will do), with Heidi being a favourite thanks to her S1 having roughly the same cycle as Degenbrecher's S3. 

The boss also deals heavy arts damage, and gains increased ATK against allies on seedbed tiles. Nightingale and her RES buffs are all but mandatory to survive its attacks at higher difficulty, though Eyjafjalla Alter's max HP buff talent can also work if you have a good number of max HP collectibles to back her up. 

Finally, Shu is a very popular pick for this boss since she can prevent it from teleporting around the map with her S3, and her Sanctuary buff helps keep your units alive alongside Nightingale. 


### Ending 4:Sands of Time/Enter Eternity (A)

For more information see [this](/is4-expeditioners/love-in-sami/) guide. 

When drafting for this ending you’ll have to keep in mind that it has 2 bosses, the Yellow King and the Red King. For the Yellow King, you’ll want to draft a physical damage DPS against him as he has an incredible amount of RES. It's easiest to just kill him instead of trying to stall him, because he has an ability similar to Crownslayer that lets him dash past the operator blocking him. The easiest way to deal with the Yellow King is to use a liberator like Młynar. Młynar has 0 block by default so he won’t trigger the Yellow King’s dash, and his skill (when activated at a specific time) is short enough that he goes back to 0 block before the Yellow King reaches him again. 

To deal with the Red King, you’ll want Arts damage since he has a very high DEF. Some examples include Logos, who just has high damage overall, Ceobe, whose damage scales with enemy DEF, or Nymph. Nymph's damage is a little lower among these three, but she can permanently CC the Red King with S2 given some assistance from relics or operators. If you have enough physical damage collectibles or debuffs, a high physical damage per hit operator like Ray buffed by Warfarin can also just outscale the Red King's DEF. 


## The Meta

Having gone over the basic ideas of what you'll need in IS4, let's now go over some of the meta operators in detail and explain how they meet the demands of IS4. Note again that these are not the only operators that are viable in IS4 even on D15, they're just the most common faces thanks to their consistent performance.

## Guards

### Degenbrecher

Degenbrecher is one of the most popular starting operators in IS4. She does incredibly well in the vast majority of stages, including boss stages. Her high physical burst damage S3 has a good range and relatively low 30 SP cost, meaning she can catch most enemy waves on regular maps, and she can also hit troublesome air enemies like Collapsed Constructs with it. All her skills are final damage multipliers, so she scales well with all kinds of buffs both from collectibles and other operators, and the low DEF of most IS4 enemies means she will rarely need more than one S3 use to kill them even on late floors. The shift effect prevents enemies from leaving her range while she's using it, the 20 starting SP means she can use it to open fast maps, and she's untargetable while it's active for some bonus survivability. The Frighten debuff on her talent can also come in clutch when it procs, letting her buy precious seconds to get her skill up, though the RNG involved means it's not reliable outside her skills applying it. Finally, she's capable of decent AOE burst damage even at E1 with her S2, which is what makes her so strong as a starting pick.

[Here](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLafQQ7F8F-gDp9Tb80QYL-YmyBA9GP1Nz&si=jgU0joFOaOZaDnG1) is a playlist showing how to clear a majority of the stages as well as endings in IS4 with Degenbrecher as core operator. 

### Młynar

Mr. Schwing himself, Młynar is a powerhouse in IS4 for his massive on-skill DPS and somewhat rare utility of the taunt status. Młynar's taunt is incredibly strong because it allows you to ignore deployment order for pocket change in DP, meaning you can deploy frontliners early to charge skills without worrying about your ranged units being targeted by enemies later. This can be particularly useful on stages where there are near global range enemies (such as "March of the Dead" or ED1 stuns) and when you have Barometric Disorder, which can limit your opening options greatly. His high damage, taunt, and Liberator block are also crucial to the most common ED4 strategy. S3 is his bread and butter skill. It’s great on every stage of IS4 for its long duration, AOE damage, and ability to hit aerial units like the Collapsed Constructs. It also scales extremely well with ASPD, so collectibles and fordaltals that increase it synergize well with him. 

Small thing to note, the Liberator trait ATK buff increases over time independent of SP, so things that increase Młynar’s SP recovery can lead to his skill being up before the ATK buff is fully charged. Just keep this in mind so you don’t auto pilot activate without it being charged up fully, this is really only relevant on enemies you can’t kill in one cycle like bosses. 

### Zuo Le

Zuo Le's main strength lies in the fast-cycling stun on his S3, and his capacity for solo holding lanes on various boss stages. He can solo hold the right side of both ED1 maps, the bottom center-left of both ED4 maps, the rightmost lane in the alternate version of ED2, and he only needs minimal support to manage the right side of the blue box on both versions of ED3. He also scales extremely well with the various CC duration and SP recovery relics found in IS4, so his value increases if you have more of those. 

Zuo Le is a significantly lower priority operator than the other two mentioned, meaning he mostly shows up in Guard/Vanguard squads, and only later in the run after more crucial Guard operators have already been recruited. Since he's usually recruited later in the run, you ideally only get him as a pre-promoted E2, since you can't count on having the hope or vouchers to promote him before you reach the maps where you need him otherwise.


## Vanguards

### Ines

Ines is by far the most value for your Vanguard voucher thanks to the wide range of utility she has beyond DP generation. Her ability to bind enemies for a few seconds is valuable crowd control and allows her to get her skill up, damage enemies, and print DP without being overrun. Her S2 further increases her survivability through Camouflage, it scales incredibly well with ASPD and initial SP collectibles, and it has some niche usage in slowing down the ED2 boss' attacks enough to unfreeze the operator that's blocking him. Finally, her Shadow Sentry reduces movement speed and reveals invisible enemies such as the Record Keepers in "Where be No Mounts and Seas", and she can even provide this utility without being on the field herself, saving you a valuable deployment slot. 

Ines uses S2 in IS4 99% of the time, but it’s worth mentioning that S3 does see usage if you are in a Bosky and the effect is having much lower deployment limit but extremely reduced redeployment time. 

### Elysium/Wanqing/Myrtle 

Thanks to the sheer amount of things Ines can do, no other Vanguards have made a name in the IS4 meta, save for Flagbearers in the cases where Ines' DP generation alone is not enough.

Flagbearers are extremely cheap to draft when playing Guard/Vanguard squad, but should only be taken if offered as a pre-promoted E2 and you already have Ines (unless you don’t have the hope for Ines yet). You won't need more than one of them per run, so having multiple flagbearers raised is only useful to increase your chances of getting one of them pre-promoted on a voucher. Their S1 is all you really care about here, and the other parts of their kit don’t matter much (most notable would be Elysium’s -DP cost to snipers when deployed), including whatever their module offers. Without the reduced hope cost of the Guard/Vanguard squad, Flagbearers become more of a luxury, only worth considering if you're either swimming in Hope or have Barometric Anomaly gutting your natural DP gain. The collectible Blunt Claws - Fuel negates the need to ever get a second Vanguard, and since you're only bringing a Flagbearer to print DP faster anyway, the marginally faster DP that Saileach prints doesn't do much to justify the extra Hope she costs compared to her lower rarity colleagues. 


## Specialists

### Ela

Ela is the premier E2 starter for Specialist/Caster squad players and a favourite for her insane role compression. Unfortunately, as a limited collab character, the chances of her getting another banner are low. Ela's various strengths include her low deployment cost, her ability to be placed on both high and low ground tiles, and her mines which inflict AOE Fragile and Slow debuffs. Her cheap deployment cost and flexible positioning make her a good opener for fast maps, her debuffs offer valuable crowd control and burst damage improvements, and her damage against enemies affected by her mines is nothing to sneeze at either. She also benefits from Empty Fowlbeast, as her mines count as summons. Simply put down a mine somewhere on the map where it won’t be triggered and she’ll have permanent uptime.

### Kirin R Yato (Yato Alter)

Yato is another popular E2 starter pick in Specialist/Caster squads, a priority choice for Specialist vouchers in any squad, and unfortunately another limited collab character. Many established strategies using Yato rely on her reduced redeployment time from potential 4, so be mindful of that when referencing videos or guides using her, and consider picking a pot4 Yato as support unit. 

Yato's main contribution is her high burst damage. Remember that IS4 maps often come in waves of low-ish DEF enemies, and Yato's high instant burst of physical damage can easily dispose of them. S3 can hit air enemies and is strong against loosely grouped enemies, and it can travel to potentially reach places you otherwise couldn't. S2 is generally to assassinate isolated priority targets such as Distorted Casters, but it hits all enemies in her range, so it's also very effective against enemies bunched up on a single tile. S1 sees less use, but the total skill damage is quite high, so in cases where enemies stand still long enough to get the whole duration it's a good choice.

One benefit of Yato's skills is that her S3 makes her completely invincible until all the skill damage has been done, and her S2 makes her immune to negative statuses like stun or freeze until she's done all the hits, so she's incredibly safe to deploy in that you're pretty much guaranteed to get all her skill damage. The S2 taunt can also protect some of your other units in a pinch. 

Another reason why Yato is taken over other Executor Specialists is that she has the module that refunds more DP on retreat. This is great because DP can be a very scarce resource in IS4 due to many stages opening extremely quickly and the possibility of being hit with Barometric. Never underestimate how much those few extra deployment points matter. 

- Note: if you aren’t playing Specialist/Caster squad and wondering whether to draft Ela or Yato Alter first, check if your squad is strong enough to support a useless E1. Yato Alter has a lot more power at E1 than Ela E1 so if you need immediate power then pick Yato. 

### Texas the Omertosa

The second go-to FRD for IS4, and one that players are slightly more likely to have than Yato. The primary things Texas offers are her 8 seconds of AOE anti-air Stun on S3, potentially longer if she kills an enemy before retreating, and the -30% RES debuff on S2. This S2 debuff in particular combos well with Reed Alter's S2 to sandwich enemies with a ton of arts damage. 

Texas has less durabilty than Yato due to being targetable during all her skills, and getting Injury Crisis means she will often get killed before she can get her full skil duration out. Texas also does not (yet) have the increased DP refund module, meaning she costs a lot more DP than Yato in the long run, which can be especially noticable if you get hit with Barometric. Both of these issues are what make Yato the more popular Fast-redeploy pick for those who have her. 

### Ascalon

Ascalon has powerful true AOE movement speed reduction (up to -85% on ground enemies between skill, talent, and module) on a very fast cycle with respectable damage, making her great at crowd control and buying time for skills and redeployment timers in most stages. Her 0 block, negative taunt, and high dodge rate as an Ambusher makes her fairly safe to deploy in relatively dangerous positions. She also does well in ED2 because her movement speed reduction bypasses the boss' slow immunity, and she can take the bottom right on ED4 with some support. Note that although S2 says it only affects ground units, the movement speed reduction on it also affects aerial units in her range.

There are many powerful Specialists in IS4, and usually Ela plus a Fast-redeploy take priority, so it can be hard to find a spot for Ascalon without the reduced hope cost on Caster/Specialist squads. She becomes more attractive for people who don't have Ela.

## Casters

### Nymph

Nymph is an exception to the rule of Casters generally underperforming in IS, her CC capabilities are incredible as a majority of enemies in the game are not immune to Fear, her specialty. Her Fear’s 5 second duration combined with S2's low SP cost of 12 means you can very easily permanently CC a target, which is important against enemies like Shattered Champions and the bosses in ED2 and ED4. She buys you a lot of time to get your team’s skills up. Her damage is also respectable as she can proc Necrosis on targets below 40 RES instantly. The Enfeeble from Necrosis can be useful as well, as it relieves healing pressure from your medics for the duration of the effect. The low SP cost and multiple charges on her S2 means it synergizes extremely well with SP recovery relics as well as the Portable Supply Station.  

### Logos

Great pick for Specialist/Caster squad players when pre-promoted, especially since Caster voucher has little competition. As a certain EN representative likes to call it, “he’s basically Arts Młynar.” Logos’ main strength comes from his amazing DPS when S3 is active and ability to remove a flat -10 RES from enemies he hits. He can reliably proc Necrosis by himself which just adds to his total damage and provides Enfeeble utility to your team if you don’t have Nymph. His ability to both be a boss DPS and clear groups of enemies makes him a powerful pick. His wide range high power arts damage makes him a good option to deal with the Red King in ED4. 

## Snipers

### Ray (Best Bnnuy)

Sniper vouchers aren’t too competitive in IS4, and it can be hard to utilize snipers well because enemies sprint outside of their range often and most of them don't offer much utility beyond damage. This weakness doesn’t apply to Ray as she has the ability to bind enemies during S3, locking them down in her range to DPS at leisure. Being able to extend her own range with the Sandbeast gives her access to more versatile positioning which is important on maps with restrictive ranged tiles. Her skill also has a relatively low cycle, allowing her to constantly have it in time for the next wave of enemies. Her extremely high base ATK and damage per hit means she synergizes well with buffs from other operators like Warfarin and relics like Empty Fowlbeast, since Sandbeast counts as a summon. Ray’s high ATK and DPS on skill allows her to have usage on most stages (so long as ranged tiles aren’t scarce). It also makes her a potential solution for ED4’s Red King if she’s paired with Warfarin as she can actually break through the King’s incredible DEF. 

### Wisadel

Cockroach go boom, enemies die, repeat. Aside from raw damage, the slows and stuns in her kit also bring valuable crowd control, making her useful on basically every stage. She synergizes exceptionally well with Empty Fowlbeast thanks to her Revenant Shadows. The camouflage fronm her summons gives her protection against ED1 and ED3 bosses’ ranged attacks, and spawning them after your operators with S3 can let them draw aggro which is particularly useful against the ED1 boss’ stun ability. Do note that she can mess with the cannon cycles on the Kings in ED4, so be careful when using her there. 

### Rosmontis

With her IS module, Rosmontis provides much of the same utility as Wisadel with her pillars, offering stuns, baits, and Fowlbeast synergy. She can be DP hungry though, as you need to deploy other Snipers and Casters to make the most of her pillars.

## Medics

### Reed The Flame Shadow

Reed Alter is a powerful tempo pick in IS4 and great en-route to the bosses, but she doesn’t scale as well as someone like Ela into the later floors, so the added value she provides your team drops off past F3 and your Hope might be better spent on others after that. Earlier in the run, she’s an amazing pickup for your squad for her utility, versatility, burst healing, and respectable damage. Her Cinder debuff is extremely powerful because both the ATK debuff and Arts Fragile portions increase Reed’s healing output and provide safety for her team, healing pressure is no joke in IS4 when you’re forced to block. She has amazing burst healing and damage on both S2 and S3. 

It’s important to note that when using S2, you want the fireballs to land in a way where an enemy is being hit by both sets of fireballs. There are many ways to do this, whether that be sandwiching an enemy between two melee units or one ranged and one melee. The burst healing from S2 is so high it can keep your operators alive even while blocking a Shattered Champion. S3 is great on multiple stages with grouped enemies as well as stages like F3’s “So Close Yet So Far” and F4’s “Collaspal Afternoon” (provided she has some support in killing an enemy to start the chain reaction). The chain explosion is also great in the normal version of ED1 where it can clear the ice on the tiles well. Note that on D15, Reed needs to be max level and have the additoinal HP from her module to be able to survive being hit once on ED1 without HP collectibles. 

### Eyjafjalla the Hvít Aska

Elemental Damage isn’t really an issue in IS4, and Wandering Medics are usually supposed to have weaker heals in return for their wide range and being able to heal elemental injury, but Eyja Alter completely throws this out the window. She has very high total healing from each heal because of her talent, and powerful burst healing during S3 which additionally provides your team with a significant 40% Max HP buff for its 50 second duration. That long duration is particularly important, 50 seconds is more than enough time for your units to recharge their skills, giving her good stall potential. It’s important to note that Eyja Alter does not fare that well in ED3 at D15 if you don’t have collectibles boosting your Max HP as the boss will just oneshot your operators, rendering that burst healing useless. 

### Warfarin

Warfarin offers your team one of the most powerful ATK buffs in the game and an SP battery passive for a lower recruitment cost by virtue of being a 5*. She allows Ray to punch through the Red King's DEF in ED4 for example, and juices up Degenbrecher S3 for the ED4 boss’ very short burst window. Warfarin scales well with most generic ATK and SP relics, but also scales well with relics and fordaltals that buff your teams % Max HP thanks to her S1 scaling off the target's max HP. Her SP charging potential is really strong when properly utilized, but can be somewhat difficult and awkward to use due to its random targeting. You’ll often find yourself ditching the SP battery portion of her kit to ensure that the S2 buff lands on your main carry. 

## Supporters

### Angelina

One of the biggest glow ups in Arknights history. Her IS Module turned her into a top priority draft for her high damage and permanent CC on skill. She can permanently Levitate up to 5 enemies for 25 seconds with S3 while also doing an insane amount of damage to them. Her low SP costs and respectable durations mean Angelina can cycle between waves easily and scales well with SP collectibles. She also makes the Levitate related collectibles actually have some value to them. One of IS4’s most dangerous elites, Shattered Champions, get 1 cycled by Angelina S3 at D15 on F6 where enemies have the most amount of stats possible. If Angelina’s damage isn’t enough, 25 seconds is usually enough time for one of your other carries to get their skill back up. It’s hard to overstate how broken Angelina is, she is incredibly high value. 

### Heidi

Degenbrecher’s best friend and ideal buffer. IS4 players love Heidi because her S1 provides a very high ATK Inspiration buff to popular carry operators like Degenbrecher and Młynar. The block reduction is a benefit here as it allows dangerous melee enemies to pass by your operators instead of beating them to a pulp, saving your setup from being demolished. It also has a similar cycle to Degenbrecher’s S3, meaning you’ll have them up around the same time. She passively provides a small ATK buff and some healing as a cherry on top. Heidi and her tokens can be picked up for free by doing the Main Story (chapter 10), so she’s easily accessible to players. Having such powerful buffs and being cheap to recruit makes her a very strong pick from the supporter voucher.

### Skadi the Corrupting Heart

Skadi Alter is very much a luxury pick in IS4, especially when Heidi exists for cheaper and Angelina takes priority in the Supporter voucher. This puts her in a similar situation to Ascalon, but much like Ascalon, Skadi Alter has her fair share of utility to still make her worth considering. S3 serves as your go to for ATK buffing, letting you compensate for a lack of damage collectibles, and it’s especially good against ED3 where every source of damage increases matters and serves a similar role to Warfarin S2 and Heidi S1. The bonus DEF from S2 has historically seen usage on ED2 to help tank the boss by relieving healing pressure if your team is lacking some defensive power. S1 isn’t too important in comparison, but can act as a powerful defensive buffer on stages like F5’s “Instinct Contamination". Her Seaborn gives her good synergy with the Empty Fowlbeast relic as more ATK to Skadi Alter = more ATK to allies. 

### Quercus

There will be times while playing IS where you don’t get a single Medic voucher for a majority of the run. This is where Quercus comes in to help you salvage your run, acting as your medic that you can draft from the Supporter voucher. Her HPS is pretty high and compares to the likes of Eyja Alter. Being a 5* also means you aren’t sacrificing a lot of hope in order to draft her, but chances are if you’re that starved for heals you don’t really have the room to be picky. Her limitation is that outside of healing she doesn’t have much utility outside a small Sanctuary buff, as the SP feed on her S2 is tricky to use well and risky if Quercus is your only healer. 

## Defenders

### Shu

Defenders suffer a similar fate to Casters in IS where it’s hard to justify their expensive Hope cost for the value they bring, especially so in IS4 where on later floors most melee units get rolled over by enemies with short attack intervals and high ATK. As a result, Shu is the only defender to have made a name in the IS4 D15 meta.

Shu is an exception among defenders for 3 reasons: she has great burst healing, she gives a powerful Sanctuary buff to allies on her sowed tiles, and she has amazing CC with her ability to teleport enemies back to tiles they passed earlier using S3. That last point is especially important to common ED2 and ED3 solutions, and makes her one of the most potent options when drafting for endings. As a bonus, she also provides %ATK and ASPD buffs while her S3 is active.

## High difficulty drafts

The section below will contain operators that are unnecessary at lower difficulties, but pretty much essential requirements at higher difficulties. The reason they are not included in the area above is because these are exclusively picked for boss reasons and don’t serve much of a purpose outside of them. I also just didn’t feel like making another document for them.

### Nightingale 

Nightingale is an absolute necessity in ED3 at D15 due to the boss dealing an insane amount of arts damage at higher difficulties that will oneshot your operators without the RES boost from Nightingale S3. She also does well in ED4 as a healer against the Yellow King who does Arts damage. Her raw healing output is comparatively low and she's expensive to recruit outside Sniper/Medic squads, so she's usually drafted later into the run. If you do find yourself with her earlier, her cages can serve as decent bait. 

### Gravel

Drafted exclusively for ED4 as bait and an emergency blocker. Specialist/Caster squad players can draft her earlier if you somehow have a throwaway Specialist voucher, but that will rarely happen. You use Gravel to block the Red King and force him to use his ability on himself. More information found in [this](/is4-expeditioners/love-in-sami/) guide on ED4

## Low Rarity Units

Sometimes it is better to pick a 3 star over a temp 4 star if the temp 4 star is bad (eg: taking Ansel over temp Chestnut). Additionally, it is often better to take 2 star units or robots if you do not need the higher stats that the 3 star offers, typically later into the run when you already have your core 6 stars. The main 2 star to note is Yato Vanguard, being a pseudo fast redeploy that is good for baiting (eg: baiting bombs in F5 "Confusing Appearance" or baiting the first attack of the Secret Keepers in F5 "Where be No Mounts and Seas"). If you're using Rosmontis, Durin can also be considered since she has a lower DP cost to summon pillars with. Robots serve a similar purpose to Yato as low DP cost bait (notably important in Routeweaver Net variants of F5 "March of the Dead", especially with Injury Trigger), but they can still have some other utility, for example Lancet can serve as extra hp/s for ED2 tanking when you dont have any deployment limit collectibles, or THRM-EX can serve as a source of Fragile in ED3 burst.
