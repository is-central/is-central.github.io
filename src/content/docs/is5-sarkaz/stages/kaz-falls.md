General Strategy
-------------
Kaz Falls is an infamous stage added in IS5 DLC1. At first glance, it is quite intimidating because of the Mutant Giant Rock Spiders (spawners) which will constantly spawn Originiutant Excrescence (slugs) that have a dreadkaz mark. However, the slugs and the spawners if left alone will walk off the cliff by themselves. As such, our objective becomes clear. We want to completely ignore them and never hit them, and only protect the area in front of the blue box. This is relatively easy, though there are a few factors which complicate it.

The first complicating factor are the Holy Automaton (drills) which will spawn from the bottom red box and enter the blue box. They do not leak for life points, but they'll inflict physical damage to everything on the field including to the slugs. This is a problem because this can cause slugs to die thus releasing dreadkaz and necrosis fields everywhere. With Talons of Hatred a single drill leaking on Emergency will cause slugs to die. With Lamp or Doodle, 2 must leak for the slugs to die. Thankfully the dreadkaz will still simply walk off the cliff, but the rightmost ranged tiles will be covered by the necrosis fields. This can make using ranged operators difficult, though there is counterplay. The easiest form of counterplay is to simply use melee operators. Placing Gummy in front of the blue box and then Guard Amiya on s2 directly below her easily solves the stage. Since the necrosis field will never reach them it's not a cause for concern. Another solution is to use your ranged operators on the right ranged tiles (facing right) and simply kill 2/3 of the drills. For most ranged E2 starts such a task shouldn't be hard if you have some form of crowd control. The final approach is to simply tank the necrosis field if your ranged carry doesn't mind necrosis. Simply place Gummy so that she can heal the ranged tiles and ignore the drills. Note that your ranged op needs to be able to live multiple drills or at least kill one.

The second complicating factor is the rng spawn on this stage. There is a 79% chance of 3 Snipers spawning over the course of the stage. This is usually not a problem to deal with, just place an operator to tank the stun shot they do. There is also a 21% chance of a 'Redmark' Infiltrator spawning instead of the snipers. This is somewhat troublesome to deal with because it introduces a dps check. We must kill the mirage in order for the Infiltrator to become blockable. The easiest way to do this is to use Guard Amiya s2 since it one shots the mirage. Just hit the Infiltrator once and then click skill once the mirage comes out. 

Epochs
-------------
Sufferings Epoch is quite annoying because you often lack medics or tiles to place down medics in this stage.

Catastrophes completely shuts down the bottom ranged tile which is usually the preferred ranged operator tile. This map is also quite tricky to stall for a lot of squads in order to get the spine.

King of Sarkaz when combined with Talons of Hatred can make it so that Gummy cannot solo the mobs since they are Sarkaz.
