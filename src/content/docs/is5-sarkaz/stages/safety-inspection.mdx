**Skills**
- Yato S1
- May S1
- Beanstalk S2

#### Strategy
1. Start the stage by immediately deploying Yato on D3 facing left to kill the Sarkaz Maze Returner.
   - (NM) undeploy Yato as soon as it dies
   - (EM) undeploy Yato after letting her push and attack the second Sarkaz Maze Returner but before she dies.
2. Deploy May on C8 facing up when enough DP is avaliable.

3. Deploy Yato on 
   - (NM) D5 facing the spine.
   - (EM) D4 facing the second Sarkaz Maze Returner until it has around 5% HP remaining and then on D5 facing the spine.
   - Yato will be undeployed as soon as her skill finishes or dies and redeployed immediately as her redeployment cooldown finishes.
    - (NM bottom spine) One of the 3 Sarkaz Swordman that walk through the originium tile on D# will remain alive, place Yato on D4 to finish it and retreat immediately as it dies.
4. After the last 3 enemies get stuck on the Shieldguard, redeploy May and Beanstalk to speed up clearing the spine.

#### Animals
* Gopnik: place Yato on C5 facing up as Gopnik walks in range.
* Crying Thief: place Beanstalk's plant in a tile across its path to get it stuck with S2 for Yato to kill it.
* Duck Lord: saving May to be deployed on F7 facing down and Yato on C6 facing up might be able to kill it.
* Fatty: Yato will eventually kill it.
