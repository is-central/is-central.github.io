# Crimson Corridor 

## Regular Difficulty 7/10

Crimson corridor is the most difficult floor 4 stage pre-dlc stages and it still holds up to this day. The stage constantly throws out waves of touch of sanguinarch slugs that immediately go to the blue box. The waves of slugs begin as soon as the map starts but thankfully we have roadblocks in the way to help buy sometime. On the regular version of this stage, the biggest problem of the stage is mainly the slugs as the waves are spaced out between slugs and non-slug enemies. Sarkaz tanks spawn on the top left side of the stage and these enemies can hit ranged tiles but is manageable as they dont spawn until later in the stage.

## Emergency 10/10

On the emergency variant, this stage ramps up the difficulty even further by spawning 2 sarkaz heirbearer tanks at the start of the stage which further increases the damage of the slugs and gives the slugs necrosis damage on hit. The roadblocks on the emergency variant falls even faster and without a good solution to initial onslaught of slugs is a run ender. sarkaz heirbearer tanks at the start of the stage which further increases the damage of the slugs and gives the slugs necrosis damage on hit. The roadblocks on the emergency variant falls even faster and without a good solution to initial onslaught of slugs is a run ender. The sarkaz tanks are also a big problem as they spawn at the start and lock out alot of the ranged tiles on the right side of the map and the left tank moves close to ranged tiles on the left early on and add more pressure to operator healing.

## Cadence

The cadence is adds alot of pressure to this stage. Players dont start with alot of dp to handle the waves and the cadence adds a timer to the operators deployed as they take constant damage from the cadence. This stage is a good stage to kill the cadence as the cadence idles for a long time in the stage and with usual strats of bring crowdcontrol, the cadence is usually just a casualty of trying to handle the slug waves.

## Deadly Epochs and debuffs

###  Oddities

- Oddities makes this stages extremely difficult as the slugs go from 3300hp to 5000hp on the normal version and 5000hp to 7500hp on the emergency variant. This means that strong relics and operators are required going into this stage.

### Commerce

- The +5 dp costs to every operator makes the intial barrage of slugs very difficult to deal with especially without intial dp.

### Catastrophes

- The spine on the stage locks out the right side of the stage and makes positioning very awkward and difficult.

### Ylis ravings

- The -20sp on deploy debuff makes certain operators unviable for the stage as their windup for the skill activation is too long and can cause issues. If players are aware, this debuff can be played around with proper drafting/deployment order but can be deadly in this stage.

## Recommendations

It is highly recommended to be lucid(green toil limit) for this stage on higher difficulties as the stage demands an answer to the slugs from the get go and the initial dp cost and potentially slower sp regen might not allow operators to activate their skills in a timely manner.

True damage is highly recommended for this stage as the slugs have at most 3300hp with a staggering 90% damage reduction. AOE damage is also recommended as the enemies are usually clustered around each other. Crowd-control is also recommended over tanking the slugs as although they might have lower atk compared to other enemies, the sheer numbers that blockers have to handle plus the low amount of viable range tiles makes it awkward to setup.

## Good Operators

- **Amiya(medic)** - Amiya s2 can be deployed as the first operator and she can handle the initial wave of slugs all by herself while her s2 is active

- **Virtuosa** - elemental damage is very good against the slugs and her true aoe application makes her a premium afk solution to the stage

- **Flingers** - Wisadel/GreyAlter/Rosmontis are all very good operators in this stage as they all do triple hit true aoe damage to the slugs and with their good range can be placed on less contested range tiles

- **Logos** - Logos s1 once active can deal with the slugs indefinitely and eases the burden of the stage but activating the skill is a whole challenge in itself and can cause deaths if no other solution is used to stall until it activates. Logos s3 is a very strong skill as it still inflicts elemental damage and with the hand of mystery can be reliably up between waves.

- **Ela** - Ela s2 on this stage is a very strong pick as the aoe stun is valuable for stalling the slugs if skills are not ready yet and with the skill active it allows ela to do true aoe damage and deal a decent amount of damage to slugs. With the Torment inspirer active Ela s2m1 stun mines can proc elemental damage per stun mine and can be used as a pseudo solution to the stage.
