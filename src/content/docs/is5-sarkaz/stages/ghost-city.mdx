<StrategySection title="Stage Analysis" author="Bait" defaultOpen={true}>

Ghost City is a stage which is a moderate AOE and opener check. The first Touch of the Sanguinarch (slug) will reach the middle of the stage
when you have 30 dp and will be at the blue box at 40. While this doesn't require an especially fast opener, it still requires a proper 
response in order to not get overrun. The stage will repeatedly spawn waves of slugs and Gift of the Sanguinarch.

Scattered throughout the map are Twigs that Crave (trees) which house Rot Eaters. If we allow the stage to end without destroying one of them. The Rot Eaters
will emerge with fully buffed stats (111653 hp, 4752 attack, 1000 defence on Emergency) which while manageable when alone, becomes untenable when we have multiple of them at once.

There are also Vesperwings (bats) that spawn halfway through the stage to harass your ranged ops a bit. They are extremely fragile however so any form
of anti air is usually enough to deal with them.

With the description of the stage done, it becomes clear what the general strategy of the map is. We want to set up our operators to first hold off the waves of slugs.
Of note is that vanguards can be deployed on the tile directly above the bottom left ranged tile since it is completely safe from enemies until the bats come.
This safe tile for vanguards makes opening far more easy since it means the agent can hit slugs and the tree constantly. After we're sure that we
can hold off the slugs, we then direct our attention to the trees that house the Rot Eaters. We want to deal with the Rot Eaters
earlier on in the stage so that their stats are lower and thus far easier to kill. We usually deal with the rightmost trees first since the left Rot Eaters can
be clumped and bursted together at the end. The right Rot Eaters on the other hand tend to spawn directly in front or behind our defensive line which makes them
inconvenient to deal with at the end. Finally, we place down an anti-air operator such as Kroos Alter to deal with the bats.

## Cadence

The cadence makes opening the stage a bit harder since we want to place down our agent and operator to hold off the slugs early.
The cadence also can distract your operators from hitting the slugs since it will run towards the exit and thus be closer to the blue box.
As such, it is important to conscious of your operator ranges so that the cadence will be mostly out of range by the time the slugs arrive.

## Notable Epochs and debuffs

###  Oddities

- Significantly increases the damage check because of the +50% hp buff.

### Commerce

- +5 dp makes opening harder, especially in tandem with the Cadence.

### Gul'dul's Silence

- +3000 Defence can allow the slugs to overrun your operators if they attack too slowly or simply lack the stats.

## Recommendations

This stage is ultimately fairly easy. You need to be have some AOE/true damage, a vanguard and some anti-air. 

## Good Operators

- Flingers do especially well since they do AOE damage.

- Medic Amiya can open with a blocker if needed.

- Kal'tsit can be your AOE dps and medic.
