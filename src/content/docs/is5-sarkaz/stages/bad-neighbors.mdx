## Stage Strategies

import StrategySection from '../../../../components/StrategySection.astro';

<StrategySection title="Vanguard / Guard Strategy" author="Mei of May">
  **Standard Method**

  Deploy Silverash two tiles below the blue box facing right. A common mistake is to point Silverash facing down, which is unable to take Duck Lord or Fatty. Activate S3 immediately so it cycles back in time for hidden enemies, no need to wait for the Sax, Silverash's autos can finish it off.

  If there are no hidden animals and you want to go AFK, deploy Medmiya to the right of Silverash facing left, you may now go AFK.

  **3 step AFK placements**

  If there are hidden animals, deploy Amiya two tiles to the right of Silverash facing left and Deepcolour to the left of Silverash.

  **anti-animal placements**

  ### Hidden Animals and Chests

  - **Duck**: activate Silverash skill immediately as the Duck enters range, activate Medmiya S2 immediately as the Duck enters range, this should be enough damage and MSPD reduction to take out the Duck. We deploy Silverash to the right so that he has more tiles to DPS the Duck.
  - **Dog**: Silverash has anti-invis, just activate his skill.
  - **Gopnik**: use Deepcolour's Tentacles to squish him down the hole, the timing isn't too tight, Silverash can also kill him outright.
  - **Fatty**: activate Silverash skill as he enters Amiya's range, activate both skills. We deploy Silverash to the right so that he has more tiles to DPS Fatty without his damage reduction.

  If there are treasure chests on the bottom left corner, use Deepcolour to take them out/activate them for Silverash or use Medmiya to heal them. If Deepcolour doesn't take out the treasure chest before the Sarkaz sniper, stall it out of range with her Tentacles.

  ### Debuffs

  - **Yellow toll**: Do not unnecessarily enter with Yellow toll because Silverash will lack damage for a potential EM Duck, but it will still be trivial.
  - **Catastrophes**: point Silverash downwards and cycle 2 skills on the Spines, making sure to retreat Silverash for a faster cycle. You will need Deepcolour and Medmiya to lanehold.
  - **Commerce**: no effect
  - **Congestion**: no effect
  - **King of Sarkaz**: you will need to squish Sarkaz snipers down the hole with Deepcolour's Tentacles, they hit too hard for your high tiles to facetank.
  - **Sufferings**: no effect
  - **Oddities**: you will need to squish the elites down the hole, otherwise they clog up Silverash's block count with their increased HP
