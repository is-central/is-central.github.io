This is a collection of references for the paths taken by the boats/Padmasanas of Rebirth in the Ending 1/Ending 1 Alter/Ending 2/Ending 2 Alter stages when you have Anasa's Karma.

## Ending 1: Emergency Teaching 

This map has 5 boats in all, one that is prespawned in wave 1, 2 more that spawn at the beginning of wave 2 and 2 more that spawn around the middle of wave 2.

The 1st boat is pre-spawned on (6, 5) at the start of the map and takes the following route:

![ED1 Boat route 1](/guides/general-knowledge/boats-routes/route_1_ed1.png)

The 2nd and 3rd boat spawn at the beginning (6 seconds into, to be specific) of wave 2. (Note that by wave 2, I mean the wave of 27 enemies that begins spawning either after all 47 non-boss wave 1 enemies are killed AND Fremont has been pushed to his 2nd phase, or 190 seconds has passed after the last enemy of wave 1 has spawned.) 

They take the following paths: 

![ED1 Boat route 2](/guides/general-knowledge/boats-routes/route_2_ed1.png)

and

![ED1 Boat route 3](/guides/general-knowledge/boats-routes/route_3_ed1.png)

The 4th and 5th boat spawn at 91 seconds into wave 2. 

They take the following paths:

![ED1 Boat route 4](/guides/general-knowledge/boats-routes/route_4_ed1.png)

and

![ED1 Boat route 5](/guides/general-knowledge/boats-routes/route_5_ed1.png)

## Ending 1 Alter: Cognitive Correction
This map has 5 boats in all, one that is prespawned in wave 1, and 4 more that spawn at the beginning of wave 2. There are no boats in the 3rd wave. 

The 1st boat is pre-spawned on (6, 5) at the start of the map and takes the following route:

![ED1a Boat route 6](/guides/general-knowledge/boats-routes/route_6_ed1a.png)

The remaining 4 boats spawn close to the beginning (16 seconds in) of wave 2. 

They take the following routes:

![ED1a Boat route 7](/guides/general-knowledge/boats-routes/route_7_ed1a.png)

![ED1a Boat route 8](/guides/general-knowledge/boats-routes/route_8_ed1a.png)

## Ending 2: Court VIsit
This map has 2 boats that normally spawn. Every time Theresa uses Shock of Will, an additional boat (not part of the enemy counter or normal spawns) will spawn. 

The 1st and 2nd boats pre-spawn wave 1. One boat spawns on (9, 6) and takes the following route: (9, 6) -> (5, 6) -> (5, 2) -> (8, 2) -> (8, 6) -> (1, 6) -> (1, 1) -> (2, 0).

![ED2 Boat route 11](/guides/general-knowledge/boats-routes/route_11_ed2.png)

The other boat spawns on (4, 6) and takes the following route: (4, 6) -> (8, 6) -> (8, 2) -> (5, 2) -> (5, 6) -> (1, 6) -> (1, 1) -> (2, 0)

![ED2 Boat route 12](/guides/general-knowledge/boats-routes/route_12_ed2.png)

Boats spawned by Theresa's Shock of Will take the following route: (2, 7) -> (10, 7) -> (10, 2) -> (9, 2) -> (9, 1) -> (9, 5) -> (4, 5) -> (4, 2) -> (3, 2) -> (3, 5) -> (2, 5) -> (2, 0)
