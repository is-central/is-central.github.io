The IS Central website is a community-driven project. We welcome contributions from the community to help us improve the website.

## How to Contribute

### Adding a new stage guide
First, go to the [IS Central GitHub repository](https://github.com/IS-Central/is-central) and **fork** the repository.

![Fork the repository](/contribute/fork.png)

You can simply click the "**Create fork**" button.

Now you have a copy of the repository on your own GitHub account, modifying the files in your fork will not affect the original repository.

Navigate to the `src/content/docs/` directory and you will see a list of all the guides.

I'll be using stage guides for IS5-Sarkaz as an example.

Navigate to the `src/content/docs/is5-sarkaz/stages/` directory and you will see a list of all the stage guides, click on the one you want to edit.

Here, I'll be editing the `ice-age.mdx` file. Which is the file for the stage "Ice Age". Go ahead and click on pencil icon to edit the file.

Woah! Code! Don't worry, you don't need to know how to code to contribute to the website.

The code is written in markdown, which is a simple markup language for writing text.

You can learn more about markdown [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/).

Write your guide in markdown format, after you're done, first paste this code block into the file:
```
import StrategySection from '../../../../components/StrategySection.astro';

<StrategySection title="Stage Analysis" author="Your Name" defaultOpen={true}>
// Your guide here
</StrategySection>
```
Now, paste your guide in between the `<StrategySection>` tags. Edit the title and author to your liking. If you prefer to have the guide open by default, set `defaultOpen` to `true`.

It should look like this:

After you're done, click on the "**Commit changes**" button at the upper right corner.
Leave all the fields as is, and click on the "**Commit changes**" button.

Now, you can submit a pull request to the original repository. Go back to your forked repository:
![pull request](/contribute/pull-request.png)

Click on the "**Contribute**" button, and click on the "**Open pull request**" button.
Add any description you want, and click on the "**Create pull request**" button.

![pull request](/contribute/create-pull.png)

Now, you've submitted your pull request! You can now wait for the pull request to be merged, and your guide will be live on the website.
