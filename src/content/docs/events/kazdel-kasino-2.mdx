## Overview

Kazdel Kasino 2 is a team-based tournament with teams of 3 players. Players earn money by completing objectives during their runs, then convert those dollars into placement points using a summon simulator at the end. The top 8 teams proceed to Round 2; the final placement is also leaderboard-based.
