# Introduction
This guide provides an extensive list of collectibles with a more detailed description of their relevant interactions. This page will basically always be a continuous work in progress, if you have any suggestions for improvements or additions or have noticed any mistakes, please contact me on discord at @kaltheresa or mention it in the IS Central discord. This guide was most recently updated on August 20th, 2025, for the IS3 D18 release.

Across all IS's, collectibles are classified in different pools, these easily identifiable through their ingots price in shops (8, 12, 16). While this pools generally define the rarity of collectibles, it has been observed that within each tier some collectibles are noticeably more common than others but the respective weights are unknown.

## Cannot Shop
### IS5

In F1 the shop contains 9 slots:
- 1 Voucher
- 1 Inspirer
- 1-3 Support kits (Small chance of obtaining 2 and extremely small of obtaining 3)
- 4-6 Collectibles (Small chance of exchanging collectible slots for a 2nd/3rd support kit)

In class squads one relic slot is taken up by a second voucher slot.

In F2+ the shop gets an additional collectible slot, while class squads maintain a total of 2 voucher slots.

Inspirers can be sold, their price depends on their respective toil accordingly:
- &lt;4: 1 ingot
- 4+: 2 ingots


## Collectibles count
The total number of collectibles in the score screen will include all that were obtained throughout the run, regardless of whether any was lost at any point. Exchanging a collectible in a Lost and Found node will allow to obtain that collectible a second time, and so appear twice in the score screen.

## Types of modifiers
Modifiers of the same type are additive with each other and multiplicative between modifiers of different types.
### External modifiers
Refers to modifiers that are applied on the operator before the stage starts, these are usually factored in before the operator is deployed.
### Internal modifiers
Refers to modifiers that are applied after an operator is deployed, these can usually vary for a number of reasons within a stage, whether it is a LP condition (King's Crown), operator isolated within a range of tiles (Rusted Blade - Lone Force), operators stacked with each other (Rock Horn), an operator being deployed for certain amount of time (Hand of Protraction), and so on.

## False to Truth

False to Truth will give you collectibles for combining Lingerers, with the collectible selected from pools that are dependent on the rarity of the lingerers. Combining Lingerers with a combined rarity of 3/5/7 stars will give you the pools for 2/4/6 stars respectively. The following image lists out which collectibles are in which pools.

# Generic Relics
- **Hot Water Kettle**
*IS2/IS3/IS4/IS5*

![collectible](https://i.imgur.com/euMpo0j.png)

*Immediately gain +2 Objective HP and +1 Hope.*

If the game runs out of collectibles to give you, it starts giving you Hot Water Kettles.

# Support Kits:
- **Support Replenishment Station**

![collectible](https://i.imgur.com/gzIJC69.png)

*Bring a Portable Supply Station along to each battle.*

The SP regeneration effect works on a lot of non-operator allied units with SP bars.

- **Support Landmine Set**

![collectible](https://i.imgur.com/qkkIEIF.png)

*Bring 3 Interference Mines along to each battle.*

The mines take 25 seconds to arm.

The mine explosion radius is 0.55 tiles.

The description states that the explosion deal 2000 True damage, but without any other damage amplification effects it actually does 3000, since the +50% damage taken effect is applied first.

- **Support Mr. Boom**

![collectible](https://i.imgur.com/q9cIFAz.png)

*Bring a Mr. Boom along to each battle.* 

The stun bomb can hit aerial units.

The stun bomb takes 1.5 seconds to detonate.

- **Support Escape Crane**

![collectible](https://i.imgur.com/Ti0ApLF.png)

*Bring a Snowsant's Safe Escape Crane along to each battle.* 

The crane reduces the operator's redeployment time by 80%. Unusually, this is multiplicative with other redeployment reduction effects.

Using the escape crane on an operator will automatically grant you the DP you'd get for retreating the operator.

The escape crane effect triggers 1 second after it is placed.

Using the escape crane in IS5 Ending 1 lets you evade getting the operator put into one of Fremont's coffins. The escape crane can be used to retreat operators on Mark of Epoch in Epoch of the Sarkaz King (which normally prevents operators on Mark of Epoch from retreating).

- **Support Riot Pile**

![collectible](https://i.imgur.com/rfc55RF.png)

*Bring 2 Riot Piles along to each battle.*

The roadblock has 4 block, 3000 HP and 100 def (before modifiers), and is immune to stun/freeze/sleep, making it useful against Crying Perro and certain CC effects like Nervous Impairment. Unlike roadblocks, it doesn't actually reroute enemies, it just acts like a blocker.

- **Support First Aid Kit**
*IS3*

![collectible](https://i.imgur.com/Oof8hCT.png)

*Bring 3 First-aid Kits to each battle.* 

The healing effect triggers 1 second after deployment.

It can heal the Last Knight, I believe.

- **Support Gas Tanks**
*IS2*

![collectible](https://i.imgur.com/BZiwmqT.png)

*Bring 2 Gas Tanks P. along to each battle.*

The push has a force of 3.
The push triggers 1.5 seconds after deployment.

I once watched a cool clear of Phantom where they used a gas tank to push a phantom clone into one of the roadblocks, causing the clone to kill the roadblock and prevent Phantom from killing a roadblock and gaining another clone. Neat.

- **Support Fog Machine**

![collectible](https://i.imgur.com/kguesiR.png)

*Bring a Broken Fog Machine along to each battle.*

It takes 5 second to arm and reduces movement speed by 60%.

# Books
## Training Books
*IS2/IS3/IS4/IS5*
Class-specific training books. Immediately promotes an operator of the corresponding class without consuming Hope.

- **Blunt Claws - Training**

## Professional Tools
- **Blunt Claws - Inspiration**
*IS2*

![collectible](https://i.imgur.com/hYfSYUk.png)

*The Redeployment Time of Vanguard Operators is reduced by -50%.*

The way -redeployment time% effects are calculated is that % reductions are applied first, then flat reductions, which generally disproportionately benefits units with in-built flat redeployment time effects. For example, P6 2 star Yato normally has a redeployment time of 65-30 = 35 seconds, but with Blunt Claws - Inspiration, she has a redeployment time of 65*0.5-30 = 2.5 seconds (which rounds to 2 seconds).

-Redeployment time% effects are additive with each other.

- **Bend Spears - Army of One**
*IS2/IS3*

![collectible](https://i.imgur.com/y0gYb9j.png)

*Guard Operators have +1 Block.*

This does not cause liberators to have 1 block while off-skill, since the liberator trait that makes them have 0 block off-skill overwrites this collectible's effect.

- **Bend Spears - Bloodbath**
*IS2/IS3/IS4/IS5*

![collectible](https://i.imgur.com/nfLfhJE.png)

*Guard Operators restore 2 SP after each attack.*

The description states 2 SP is restored after each attack, but it actually triggers on any instance of damage. For instance, Degenbrecher's autoattacks will trigger this effect twice, while Mlynar's damage reflect talent, despite not being an "attack" at all, will also trigger this effect once.

- **Iron Guard - Impenetrable**
*IS2/IS3/IS4/IS5*

![collectible](https://i.imgur.com/uUmFKOy.png)

*Defender Operators restore 2 SP after being attacked.*

This effect gets triggered by basically any source that causes a loss of HP. Attacks will trigger it, self-induced HP loss will trigger it, the Poison Mist effect in various stages will trigger it, environmental hazards like Heat Pump Passages will trigger it.

- **Stalwart Aid - Counter-Arts**
*IS2/IS3/IS4/IS5*

![collectible](https://i.imgur.com/GsVQzWo.png)

*Enemies within the attack range of Supporter Operators have -20% DEF and -20% RES.*

The -DEF/-RES effects of this collectible stack, if an enemy is in the range of multiple supporters. -20% RES constitutes a multiplicative reduction to RES, not an additive one, for example, a 50 RES enemy affected by 1 instance of this effect would have 50*(1-20%) = 40 RES, not 50-20=30 RES.

- **Stalwart Aid - Assistance**
*IS3/IS4/IS5*

![collectible](https://i.imgur.com/W794LH8.png)

*Allied units within the attack range of Supporter Operators gain +20% ATK.* 

This effect stacks, if a unit is in the range of multiple supporters, they will benefit from multiple instances of this effect.

This effect is an internal buff.

- **Rusted Blade - No Man's Land**
*IS2/IS3/IS4/IS5*

![collectible](https://i.imgur.com/Lx5eFsP.png)

*The Redeployment Time of Specialist Operators -35%.*

The way -redeployment time% effects are calculated is that % reductions are applied first, then flat reductions, which generally disproportionately benefits units with in-built flat redeployment time effects.

This effect only affects Specialist operators, it won't affect summons like Phantom's clone or Weedy's cannon.

-Redeployment time% effects are additive with each other.

- **Rusted Blade - Overwhelm**
*IS2/IS3*

![collectible](https://i.imgur.com/sV9LWch.png)

*Specialist Operators have +2 shift strength.*

This effect only affects Specialist operators, for example it turns Weedy's S3 3+4 push into a 5+4 push since it doesn't affect her cannon.

- **Rusted Blade - Spearhead Sharpening**
*IS4*

![collectible](https://i.imgur.com/NC3PjX4.png)

*Specialist Operators have +40% ATK and +2 shift strength.*

This effect only affects Specialist operators, for example it turns Weedy's S3 3+4 push into a 5+4 push since it doesn't affect her cannon.

# Economy Relics
- **Rusted Iron Hammer**
*IS2/IS3/IS4/IS5*

![collectible](https://i.imgur.com/Lb3zRNq.png)

*Rogue Trader charges -50% Originium Ingots for their goods.*

The -50% discount from Rusted Iron Hammer stacks multiplicatively with any other shop discount effects like the Wild Gold play in IS2 and the Surprise foldartal in IS4. Non-integer shop prices are rounded up.

- **Proof of Friendship**
*IS2*

![collectible](https://i.imgur.com/PblJOMm.png)

*+30% Originium Ingot drops from battle.*

Having the Proof of Friendship unlocks an option for you in the "An Eye for an Eye encounter" in which you gain 20 ingots.

- **Portable Scriptures**
*IS3*

![collectible](https://i.imgur.com/FGJK6Hk.png)

*+2 Die Rolls.*

Having this collectible forces you into the combat "Reality" in the encounter Heart of a Fool (which requires either this item or Nightsun Grass for you to enter).

- **Nightsun Grass**
*IS3*

![collectible](https://i.imgur.com/EgidYxq.png)

*+5 Light.*

Having this collectible allows you to choose between 30 ingots and a collectible that gives you an enlightenment in the Heart of a Fool encounter, and also prevents you from doing the combat "Reality."

Either this item or Portable Scriptures is required to even obtain the Heart of a Fool encounter.

- **Wordless Coral**
*IS3*

![collectible](https://i.imgur.com/snARyOm.png)

*Recover 5 Light for every die roll.*

This effect triggers even if the dice roll didn't cost you a dice, and was done through some encounter or event (like the dice roll at each wish fulfilled node).

- **Pathfinder Fin**
*IS3*

![collectible](https://i.imgur.com/VvqpUX7.png)

*+30 Light.*

This collectible is only obtainable by rolling a 7 or higher when refreshing a shop.

- **Knight Lance Pro**
*IS4/IS5*

![collectible](https://i.imgur.com/CgzowoB.png)

*Treasure Chests on the battlefield will drop more Originium Ingots.*

Specifically, this grants +1 ingot from normal chests, +5 ingots to spiked chests (IS4) and Dying Fowlbeast (IS5), and +15 ingots to Testaceous Vinecreeps (IS4) and Idle Exquisicarts (IS5). Lost Hovercrafts summoned from Machine/Industry inspirers do not benefit from this, but the Idle Exquisicarts that Cannot summons (in the shop rob fights) do.

Killing all Contraption chests spawned by Cannot in IS5 Property Dispute/Narrative Offer nets you +90 ingots with Knight Lance Pro.

- **Cannot's Mark**
*IS4/IS5*

![collectible](https://i.imgur.com/x7bfdjo.png)

*Gain 1 Hope whenever you buy an item at the Rogue Trader or make an exchange at Lost and Found.*

This grants you hope on the free "purchases" you can make while robbing Cannot's shop.

If you buy a voucher, you gain the hope from the purchase before you make your recruitment decision. If you want to recruit an operator that costs 7 hope, and you have 6 hope and Cannot's Mark, it's fine if you buy the voucher, since you'll have 7 hope by the time you actually make the recruit selection.

This relic only appears in the shop in IS4.

- **Regional Action Plan**
*IS2/IS3/IS4*

![collectible](https://i.imgur.com/3sHA1DN.png)

*4-star Operators cost -2 Hope to recruit.*

In IS4: The Tundra (>=D6) and Polar (>= D9) variants of Secret HR Letter have a 50% chance of making one 4 star pre-promoted on each voucher.

- **Comprehensive Operation File**
*IS2/IS3/IS4*

![collectible](https://i.imgur.com/0RrpND1.png)

*5-star Operators cost -2 Hope to recruit.*

In IS4: The alterform variants (>=D3) additionally give some hope, and the Tundra (>=D6) and Polar (>= D9) variants of Secret HR Letter have a 50% chance of making one 5 star pre-promoted on each voucher.

- **Secret HR Letter**
*IS2/IS3/IS4/IS5*

![collectible](https://i.imgur.com/UbHcU5q.png)

*6-star Operators cost -2 Hope to recruit.*

In IS4: The alterform variants (>=D3) additionally give some hope, and the Tundra (>=D6) and Polar (>= D9) variants of Secret HR Letter have a 50% chance of making one 6 star pre-promoted on each voucher.
In IS5: Secret HR letter makes it so there is a 20% chance that all 6 stars on a voucher are pre-promoted.

- **Slytooth, Forest Destroyer**
*IS4*

![collectible](https://i.imgur.com/WirOCU2.png)

*Battles have a chance to drop an extra 1 Foldartal.*

The chance of getting an additional foldartal drop from Slytooth is 15%. This is independent of the 40%/80% chance of foldartal drop you get from clearing a normal/emergency combat.

- **'Blindness'**
*IS4*

![collectible](https://i.imgur.com/YBOUL9E.png)

*When Anti-Interference Index is at 0 to 1, moving horizontally or vertically will randomly grant you Objective Shield, Originium Ingot, Hope, Anti-Interference Index, or Foldartal.*

Assuming the necessary condition (&lt;= 1 index) is fulfilled, you have:
- 25% chance of getting 1 shield
- 25% chance of getting 1 ingot
- 25% chance of getting 1 hope
- 15% chance of getting 1 index

- **Herr Hraaselsuher**
*IS5*

![collectible](https://i.imgur.com/AoS3ZQk.png)

*Toil Limit +2 and chance to gain 1 Plan after combat.*

You have a 50% chance of getting a plan drop at the end of each combat. Goat.

- **'Song to Make A Tenacious Mind'**
*IS5*

![collectible](https://i.imgur.com/TZM6x1U.png)

*Every Inspirer used grants +1 Shield.*

Just using the inspirer is good enough to receive a shield, you don't need to bring it into a combat. If you want, you can use an inspirer, and then overwrite it with another for multiple shields.

- **Anchor For Five Seconds Ago**
*IS5*

![collectible](https://i.imgur.com/oX5LZrr.png)

*Gain 1 extra Inspirer after the battle if you used an Inspirer as the battle started.*

Works on every stage that gives a reward, including face-offs. The order in which thoughts are dropped from battles is: [base thought drop]/[rng thought drop]/[thought for pefect clear]/[thought(s) from lost/anchor]/[thought from face off].

The pool of Inspirers includes:
- Civil War
- Invasion
- Reclaim
- Slumber
- Demolition
- Lost
- Catastrophe
- Witchcraft
- Grand Wish
- Industry
- Rise and Fall
- Torment
- Flames
- Excavate
- Wall
- Furnace
- Oathbreak
- Relocation

- **Nameless Totem**
*IS5*

![collectible](https://i.imgur.com/EcFfb4i.png)

*Obtain 3 different Thoughts.*

Specifically, this collectible gives 1 thought of each type. You will receive 1 plan, 1 random inspirer, and 1 random lingerer.

- **Burdenherd Bell**
*IS5*

![collectible](https://i.imgur.com/ZXA2IoJ.png)

*Burdenbeast Traveler joins your squad; gains an additional choice when loot drops from a Wish Fulfilled node.*

The Burdenbeast Traveler provides you 2 DP per 5 seconds.

You lose this collectible if the Burdenbeast Traveler is defeated.

Safely escorting the Burdenbeast Traveler to F5 causes them to leave and grant you 1 Plan, 1 Assembly, and 1 Furnace. You do not lose the Burdenherd Bell for safely escorting them.

Having the bell lets you select an option that gives you the Speechless thought for free in the Crater Treasure encounter.

Having the bell lets you select an option that gives you an Elite HR dispatch letter (recruit any operator) for free in the Dealings in Blood encounter.

- **Masterless Memories**
*IS5*

![collectible](https://i.imgur.com/PbDHF2j.png)

*Immediately obtain 5 Thoughts at most left behind from your last adventure.*

You can only receive this if you made it to at least F4 in the previous run and then DIED. You cannot get the Pure-White Petals and Wordless Deed thoughts (the ones required for ending 2) from Masterless Memories, but you can obtain Despair, Salvation and Stasis, regardless of obtaining the ED5 thought this way, the encounter "All or Nothing" will only appear after Finale Cadence is dead.

- **Scales of Avarice**
*IS5*

![collectible](https://i.imgur.com/TUl35Nj.png)

*Gain +3 Originium Ingots for each non-combat node entered when Total Mental Toil exceeds 20.*

Ingots are received when stepping into the node, if Mental Toil is less than 20 after doing so, when spending plans to travel vertically for example, no ingots will be received.

With Lamp of Wishes, Chalice or Toy will appear if the last 3 ingots are obtained when stepping into the Wish node.

- **Eye of Fortune**
*IS5*

![collectible](https://i.imgur.com/L0eCiml.png)

*Originium Ingots +5, Operators dispatched in Scout nodes will return with 5 extra Ingots.*

Ingots will still be obtained from operators scouted before this relic was obtained that have not returned yet.

Works with Witchcraft.

- **Baby Djall**
*IS5*

![collectible](https://i.imgur.com/GeYGCip.png)

*+3 Hope, obtain an extra +8 Hope when this Collectible is exchanged in Lost and Found.*

A relic is obtained in addition to the 8 Hope.

- **Hibernating Kin**
*IS5*

![collectible](https://i.imgur.com/1QsmqgF.png)

*Hope +5, obtain an extra Collectible when this Collectible is exchanged in Lost and Found.*

When traded, the 2 relics obtained are from the boss collectibles pool.

- **Rhoder's Gate**
*IS5*

![collectible](https://i.imgur.com/ySlW1St.png)

*Immediately recruit multiple Reserve Operators; at the end of each combat, the last deployed Operator will be sent to a Scout node.*

The way the operator is selected to be sent into a Scout node is different than the standard check Witchcraft does. While Witchcraft allows retreating an operator to send the last deployed operator remaining on the field, this relic will scout the last operator deployed, regardless of whether they were retreated afterward.

If the operator that was deployed last is taken by a witchcraft portal Rhoder's Gate will not take any operator, to use both the second operator has to be deployed after the operator kidnapped by the portal.

# Combat Relics
## Healing Collectibles
"Friendly units restore +X% HP" effects do improve the output of regeneration effects like the Bard trait.

- **Live Rose**
*IS2/IS3/IS4/IS5*

![collectible](https://i.imgur.com/FTKSozk.png)

*All allied units have +20% healing effectiveness.*


- **White Flower Crown**

![collectible](https://i.imgur.com/6vg5mrk.png)

*All allied units receive +30% healing effectiveness and take -30% Elemental Injury.*


- **Today's Menu**
*IS2*

![collectible](https://i.imgur.com/1SHGh7x.png)

*All allied units have +40% healing effectiveness.*


## SP on deploy Collectibles
This effect is applied again whenever an operator utilizes the "Move" mechanic (Ulpianus S3, Mon3tr S3), since they are basically treated as having deployed a new operator.

I don't believe this gets reapplied to Dollkeepers when going from doll form to operator form, but I'm not sure (if anyone knows the answer to this, please let me know).

- **Ancient Gaulish Silver Coin**
*IS2/IS3/IS4/IS5*

![collectible](https://i.imgur.com/FhCRZuD.png)

*All Operators start with +6 SP.*


- **Bank of Gaul Check**
*IS2/IS3/IS4/IS5*

![collectible](https://i.imgur.com/MMX1GlE.png)

*All Operators start with +12 SP.*


- **'Second Economic Reform Act'**
*IS2/IS3/IS4/IS5*

![collectible](https://i.imgur.com/FZSlrgI.png)

*All Operators start with +18 SP.*


- **√âlys√©e Purse**
*IS2*

![collectible](https://i.imgur.com/Tnll6ZN.png)

*All Operators start with +8 SP.*


## SP regen Collectibles
This effect is additive with similar relics.

On IS5 at D18, the fractured -20% SP regen rate is applied multiplicatively to the result of this effect.
- **Vanilla Soda**
*IS2/IS3/IS4/IS5*

![collectible](https://i.imgur.com/TRD7awc.png)

*Increases the SP regen rate of Auto Recovery skills by +0.2/s.*


- **Fowlbeast Liver Plate**
*IS2/IS3/IS4/IS5*

![collectible](https://i.imgur.com/UCORbIX.png)

*Increases the SP regen rate of Auto Recovery skills by +0.35/s.*


- **Dreaming Essence**
*IS2/IS3/IS4/IS5*

![collectible](https://i.imgur.com/hHuJjEA.png)

*Increases the SP regen rate of Auto Recovery skills by +0.5/s.*


- **Ball Juice**
*IS2*

![collectible](https://i.imgur.com/Ev1oDKS.png)

*Increases the SP regen rate of Auto Recovery skills by +0.25/s.*


## Negative status Collectibles
Negative Statuses include Cold/Freeze, Fear (as in Nymph S2), and Stun. "Negative Status" is a specific set of defined effects, and these collectibles only work with that list of effects. It does not include Slow (as in the named effect that inflicts -80% movement speed and is sometimes called Sluggish), Bind, Disarm/Frighten or Levitate, all of which are considered "debuffs."
- **Victory Horn**
*IS2/IS3/IS4/IS5*

![collectible](https://i.imgur.com/kISqlS2.png)

*Duration of single instance status effects such as stun, cold or freeze is increased by 100%.*


- **Flash Camera**
*IS2/IS3/IS4/IS5*

![collectible](https://i.imgur.com/5QrfYyM.png)

*Duration of single instance status effects such as stun, cold or freeze is increased by 110%.*


- **Therapy Tape**
*IS2/IS3/IS4/IS5*

![collectible](https://i.imgur.com/aQ1dCdX.png)

*Duration of single instance status effects such as stun, cold or freeze is increased by 150%.*


## King's Relics
The "When Life Point is at 1" condition of these collectibles is checked for dynamically/in combat. If you leak to the point where your life points are at 1, the King's Relics will activate.
- **King's New Lance**
*IS2/IS3/IS4/IS5*

![collectible](https://i.imgur.com/mLzuK4F.png)

*When Life Point is 1, all allied units have +50 ASPD.*

- **King's Staff**
*IS3/IS4*

![collectible](https://i.imgur.com/BDDu8jG.png)

*When Life Point is at 1, all Operators recover an additional 1 SP every 2 seconds.*

- **King's Legacy**
*IS5*

![collectible](https://i.imgur.com/7P5MDKi.png)

*When Life Point is at 1, all Operators recover an additional 1 SP and 3% of Max HP every 2 seconds.*

- **King's Buckler**
*IS3/IS4*

![collectible](https://i.imgur.com/boPGSgD.png)

*When Life Point is at 1, all Operators have +2 Block.*

- **King's Crown**
*IS3/IS4/IS5*

![collectible](https://i.imgur.com/l0KtUjz.png)

*When Life Point is at 1, all allied units have +50% ATK, increased to +150% ATK if you have collected 3 or more King's Collectibles.*

Since the King's Crown condition is checked for dynamically it stacks additively with internal buffs, this means that the +ATK% provided by King's Crown is additive with talent/skill +ATK% and multiplicative with external modifiers.

## King of Sarkaz's Collectibles
- **Visage of Crowned Fates**
*IS5*

![collectible](https://i.imgur.com/cwSuXzJ.png)

*Shield +3; converts all remaining max Life Points into an equivalent amount of Shield before reducing max Life Points to 1.*

While this is not considered a King of Sarkaz's relic, it practically is a requirement to make them viable due to its synergy with King's relics. In IS5, the last point of Max Life gained from command level is at command level 6, if you take Visage before command level 6, leveling up will ruin its ability to allow both the King's and King of Sarkaz's sets to be simultaneously active.

- **Sarkaz King's Regal Rest**
*IS5*

![collectible](https://i.imgur.com/Hi3Z9Oy.png)

*All Operators gain +20% DEF and +10 RES at full Life Points.*


- **Sarkaz King's Torn Banner**
*IS5*

![collectible](https://i.imgur.com/9Z0RVKB.png)

*All Operators gain +30 ASPD at full Life Points.*


- **King of Sarkaz's Vessel**

If a shot's damage brings an enemy's HP below the insta-kill threshold, the enemy will be insta-killed by that shot.

You can no longer use Hand of Choker to execute the Playwright in IS2 because they correctly flagged him as a boss now.

![collectible](https://i.imgur.com/79FP5w2.png)

*All friendly units have +5 RES.*

The "Art Connosseur" encounter can only show up when you have at least one of these two collectibles.

Having both "Flowers of Quinde" and "Numbness and Obscenity" will allow you to obtain the collectible "Beauty and Ugliness in the Age of Terra."

- **'Brokenblade'** *IS2* + **'Wavebreaker'** *IS3*

![collectible](https://i.imgur.com/P3swLmB.png)

*All Operators have -25% HP, but have -50% Redeployment Time.*

The way -redeployment time% effects are calculated is that % reductions are applied first, then flat reductions, which generally disproportionately benefits units with in-built flat redeployment time effects. For example, P6 2 star Yato normally has a redeployment time of 65-30 = 35 seconds, but with Blunt Claws - Inspiration, she has a redeployment time of 65*0.5-30 = 2.5 seconds (which rounds to 2 seconds).

*Whenever you deploy a unit, deal 3000 Arts damage to a random enemy and the area around it.*

The definition of "friendly unit" is very broad and encompasses the vast majority of deployables. Something like Trapmaster mines or Swirealter's S2 bottles will trigger it.

- **Derivative Terminal - Supercharged Mod**
*IS3*

![collectible](https://i.imgur.com/eUDwpMe.png)

*Summons have +30% HP, +30% ATK, and +30 ASPD.*

This applies to many deployable units that you might not initially think of as summons, for example, it applies to Pozyomka's typewriter.

- **Distant Home's Guide**
*IS3*

![collectible](https://i.imgur.com/jFoKl3M.png)

*Designates one deployable tile at the beginning of battle; friendly units deployed on that tile will recover 1 SP and 3% Max HP per second.*

This collectible can choose some tiles that are not actually deployable on, like the water tiles on Cistern.

- **Abandoned Banner**
*IS3*

![collectible](https://i.imgur.com/YOwfAvn.png)

*Designates one deployable tile at the beginning of battle; friendly units deployed on that tile have +50% ATK and +50 ASPD.*

This collectible can choose some tiles that are not actually deployable on, like the water tiles on Cistern.

- **'Glory Pack**
*IS3/IS5*

![collectible](https://i.imgur.com/DUV88Rn.png)

*When an Operator is defeated, it will Stun all enemies in the four adjacent tiles for 6 seconds.*

Contrary to the description, the effect triggers whenever an operator or a summon dies.

Also contrary to the description, enemies are stunned in a 1.25 tile radius centered on the unit. This stun can hit aerial units.

Many operators with summons can manually trigger the effect of Glory Pack if you place their summon down, then retreat the operator, causing the summon to disappear and trigger Glory Pack. This also works if a summon naturally disappears at the end of a duration. This interaction works with summons like Skalter's Seaborn and Pozyomka's Typewriter. I'm reasonably sure it doesn't work with Kal'tsit's Mon3tr but it does with the summons of most ordinary summoners like Deepcolor. Support items (like Snowsant's Escape Crane) self-destructing after use trigger Glory Pack, as does THRM-EX self-destructing.

This also works with things like Ebenholz S2 goats, or W S2 landmines. The vast majority of Trapmaster mines do not trigger Glory Pack on activation, [although Frost's mines specifically do trigger Glory Pack.](<https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV12s4y1N7Jg>) Trapmaster mines will trigger Glory Pack if you place a mine down, and then retreat the trapmaster.

- **Palmtop Pavilion**
*IS4*

![collectible](https://i.imgur.com/CoSxBTD.png)

*All Operators gain +1 Block, and an additional +1 Block after being deployed for more than 60 seconds.*

With the exception of Liberator Guards (due to their special mechanics), this will turn 0 block units (like ambushers) into 1 block units. This is generally undesirable and you should generally skip this collectible.

- **Northwind Construct**
*IS4*

![collectible](https://i.imgur.com/kTzXI1f.png)

*[Machine] and [Arts Creations] enemies will be immediately Frozen with their first attack for 15 seconds.*

This will generally screw you over in Manmade Carnival more than it helps. Be careful about picking this collectible.

- **Paradigm Apparatus**, **Cloud-Moving Totem**, **Rusted Blade - Disturbance**
*IS4*

![collectible](https://i.imgur.com/ue70FKy.png)

*All enemies have ASPD -30 when on tiles affected by Dominion.*

*All enemies have -15% Movement Speed, and the Weightless effect further drops their Weight Level by 2.*

![collectible](https://i.imgur.com/uKyg7mn.png)

*For every Specialist Operator on the field, all enemies have -5% Movement Speed (stacks up to 8 times)*

Capable of desyncing the Liberator cycle on 4th ending. If you are going for 4th ending, you should consider skipping these (with that being said, the effect is definitely manageable and you don't have to skip them if you know what you are doing).

- **Celestial Dust**
*IS4*

![collectible](https://i.imgur.com/1LnmZmC.png)

*Ranged Operators Levitate all enemies within attack range for 2 seconds when a skill is manually activated.*

The levitate from Celestial Dust is applied before the skill, which can cause complications (in particular, with Qanipalaat, it overrides the effect of the much longer levitate from S2).

- **Ring of Thorns**
*IS4*

![collectible](https://i.imgur.com/IYNCHIs.png)

*When Melee Operators are healed, they and Operators in the adjacent 4 tiles will recover 1 SP.*

The SP gain affects not just operators, but all friendly units (including both summons and devices).

Any healing effect that produces green healing numbers will trigger this, including effects like Musha auto-attack self-heals and Silence S2 drone.

- **Clairvoyant's Reveal**
*IS4*

![collectible](https://i.imgur.com/ZNzMjxD.png)

*The DP Cost and Redeployment Time of all Operators is randomly changed.*

Each operator gets their DP cost and redeployment time set randomly to somewhere within the range of [40% of its base value, 120% of its base value].

- **Scarred Amber**
*IS4*

![collectible](https://i.imgur.com/BaWdt3u.png)

*Uncaps Anti-Interference Index Limit, and every surplus index point will grant all allied units HP +8% and ATK +8%.*

It's not known if there's an actual cap on index with Scarred Amber, but we do know that it's at least in the triple digits.

- **Roundstone Altar**
*IS4/IS5*

![collectible](https://i.imgur.com/pmDSpIF.png)

*There is a chance after battle to permanently increase all allied units' ATK and DEF by 5% (Can stack up to 10 times).*

There is a 30% chance of gaining a stack after each combat. I heard if you can stack it up to 10 in two runs in a row you can win a free trip to Disneyland.

- **Living Woodplate**
*IS4/IS5*

![collectible](https://i.imgur.com/mb6r4mW.png)

*All allied melee units gain a Barrier equal to 50% of their Max HP on deployment.*

The barrier can mitigate the 30%/60% of HP loss caused by the injury trigger/crisis trigger collapsal paradigms and a portion of HP loss from sufferings epoch.

The 50% shield is based off the HP of the operator after external buffs are applied but before internal buffs like Aegis. There seems to be an exception with Cardigan's talent which stacks additively with internal buffs but is displayed before deployment as external buffs normally do, here Cardigan's talent buff is factored in into Woodplate's shield. Generalizing, it seems to be applied based on the HP displayed on the operator stats before deployment.

- **Fincatcher's Shawl**
*IS3*

![collectible](https://i.imgur.com/9mwqk1T.png)

*Ranged Operators gain Camouflage.*

This collectible provides camouflage, not invisibility, meaning that units can still take damage from most AoE effects. A notable exception to this is the shockwaves that Izumik does in its 2nd phase. 

This collectible applies to units that are tagged as "ranged" in the in-game tag system. This means that Ela (or any other standardly ranged tile unit in conjunction with Pure White Dance Shoes) placed on a melee tile will gain camouflage. Conversely, "melee" tag units placed on ranged tiles will not gain camouflage. 

- **Finshell Shield**
*IS4*

![collectible](https://i.imgur.com/dLfjXmC.png)

*All allied ranged units gain 3 layers of Shield on deployment.*

1 shield can mitigate the 30%/60% HP loss caused by the injury trigger/crisis trigger collapsal paradigms.

- **Medicine Sticks**
*IS3/IS5*

![collectible](https://i.imgur.com/AERX7vN.png)

*All allied units gain 2 layers of Shield when deployed.*

The description specifies operators, but this grants shields to non-operator units that can take damage too, like summons or devices such as 'Gelato Stop' from Divine Desire.

- **Empty Fowlbeast**
*IS4/IS5*

![collectible](https://i.imgur.com/qewp9ht.png)

*Summons have +30% HP, +30% ATK, and when on the field, grant +60% ATK to their summoners.*

This applies to a surprising number of things. In addition to ordinary summons it also applies to things like: trapmaster mines (for many trapmasters, especially Ela, it can be helpful to place a mine in a corner that will never be triggered to maintain the effect), Ulpian's S3 return point, Wis'adel's shadows, Ebenholz's S2 goats, Rosmontis Tactical Equipments, tactician summons, etc. (This is a very incomplete list).

- **Lakebed Aegis**
*IS4/IS5*

![collectible](https://i.imgur.com/Ffx40y9.png)

*Shield +1; all allied units gain Max HP +60% if you have any Shield at the start of a battle.*

Unusually among +HP% effects, this is implemented as an internal buff, meaning the +60% HP it grants is multiplicative with most other collectibles with +HP%.

The Lakebed Aegis effect is granted as long as you had at least 1 shield when the operation starts, it doesn't matter if you lose it in the operation.

- **Children of the Walls**
*IS5*

![collectible](https://i.imgur.com/NMl3mvS.png)

*Operators deployed on the 8 tiles surrounding the Objective Point gain +2 Block and +50% Max HP.*

Another internal HP modifier.

- **'Unleashings' | 'Blossom'**
*IS2/IS3/IS4/IS5*

![collectible](https://i.imgur.com/qtNCK4i.png)

*All Operators recover 1 SP every time they take damage or Elemental Injury.*

The effect states "whenever an operator takes damage," but it's more accurately "when they lose life." Attacks will trigger it, self-induced HP loss will trigger it, the Poison Mist effect in various stages will trigger it, environmental hazards like Heat Pump Passages will trigger it.

I'm not sure whether taking an attack that inflicts both damage and elemental injury causes this to trigger once or twice (if anyone knows the answer to this, please let me know).

- **Scout's Scope**
*IS2/IS3/IS4/IS5*

![collectible](https://i.imgur.com/UklPlkP.png)

*Enemies take increased damage from allied units as range increases (max 100%).*

The description for Scout's Scope claims it maxes out at 50% in IS3, but it is incorrect, it maxes out at 100% just like it does in every IS forever.

The damage amplification provided by Scout's Scope is a final modifier applied after all other damage calculations, not an ATK% multiplier. As a result, it does not improve the ability of physical damage operators to penetrate through defense like +ATK% or ATK% multiplier effects would. 

The damage amplification provided by Scout's Scope is approximately given by the equation:
amplification = 20%*(x-1), where x is the distance between the operator and enemy measured in tiles.
The damage amplification factor cannot go below 0% or exceed 100%, so the amplification factor begins scaling at a distance of 1 tile, and maxes out a distance of 6 tiles. X is treated continuously without rounding, x=1.35 tiles and x=1.36 tiles would produce a slightly different value of amplification.

The damage amplification provided by Scout's Scope is multiplicative with effects like that of Fragile, Avenger (increased physical damage dealt) or Brilliant Lament (increased arts damage dealt), since it is a generic damage amplification effect.


- **Civilight Eterna**
*IS2/IS3/IS4/IS5*

![collectible](https://i.imgur.com/hjwVSjO.png)

*All enemies take +150% True damage.*

Most enemy self-damage effects and most environmental effects (survivalist, Originium altars etc.) that can damage enemies are implemented as true damage, which Civilight Eterna will amplify. For example, Enraged Possessed Soldiers take 350 true damage/second by default, and Civilight Eterna will amplify that to 825/second. For the "Chalice of Regret" enemy, which absorbs 95% of the damage taken by enemies in its range, and transfers it to itself as true damage, its damage transferred to itself is amplified by Civilight Eterna.

For true damage effects that are capable of hitting both enemy and allied units, Civilight Eterna will only amplify the damage if it affects an enemy.

- **Dawn of Literature**
*IS5*

![collectible](https://i.imgur.com/WKoIyjc.png)

*Deals 50% more physical and Arts damage to [Sarkaz] enemies.*

The physical/arts damage amplification effect is multiplicative with other damage amplification effects, including "enemies take +x% more physical damage" and "enemies take +x% more arts damage."

- **'Bridge of Knowledge'**
*IS5*

![collectible](https://i.imgur.com/WCVviGh.png)

*Every Inspirer used grants all allied units +5% HP (Stacks up to 10 times).*

Just using the inspirer is good enough for a stack of the buff, you don't need to bring it into a combat. If you want, you can use an inspirer, and then overwrite it with another for multiple stacks.

- **Cursed Counterbeast**
*IS5*

![collectible](https://i.imgur.com/DhP83RL.png)

*All Operators gain +5 ASPD; consumes 1 Inspirer after each battle to grant an additional 5 ASPD (stacks up to 10 times).*

Consumes Inspirers only while under 10 stacks. Can only consume Inspirers obtained previous to entering a stage and it cannot consume the Inspirer that was used in that stage.
Prioritizes consuming inspirers as follows:
- Lowest rarity > highest toil
- This prioritization order should follow the order in which they are displayed in game

- **Doodle of Hope**
*IS5*

![collectible](https://i.imgur.com/F5i9sMV.png)

*Hope +3; Emergency Ops will no longer appear when refreshing nodes; triggers wondrous effects in Encounter nodes.*

The wonderous effect is the fact that it unlocks you some new (and for the most part, better) options in a large number of non-combat encounters. These consist of:
- A Small Skiff: "Work out a way" which gives 2 Elite Logistics Rations Voucher.
- Decision in Despair: "Follow the Cyclops's prophecy" which gives 4 Life Points and Secret HR Letter.
- Falling Objects: "Get help to carry them away" which gives 3 Hope.
- Good Fortune To You: "Offer a prayer" which gives three Collectibles (for free).
- Inauguration Ceremony: "We're here for the seminar" which gives 5 Plans.
- "Please help me and my companions" which increases the Life Point cap by 4.
- Scarmarket Nexus: "Say hello to the boss" which gives 2 Hope and an Elite HR Dispatch Letter (recruit any operator).
- Story's End: "Halos appear on both their heads" which gives 4 Originium Ingots and 2 Hope.
- Turning point: "Look at the photo again" which gives +5 toil limit, 2 Deathmatch inspirers and Bane of Hatred.

In the encounter Future Hunter, Doodle unlocks the option "Present the drawing representing hope" which increases the Life Point cap by 8 in exchange for losing Doodle. 

At a Lost and Found node, if you exchange away Doodle of Hope you receive Talons of Hatred. 

- **Talons of Hatred**
*IS5*

![collectible](https://i.imgur.com/tSgnMVP.png)

*All allied units and enemies have +20% ATK; Emergency Ops will appear more often when refreshing nodes; triggers wondrous effects in Encounter nodes.*

The wonderous effect is the fact that it unlocks you the option to do harder, Emergency versions of combats in many encounters that offer a combat. These consist of:
- Quacking Mad: "Stab the duck right through" which forces the player into the Emergency version of Duck-Speed Highway.
- The Pious Worshiper: "Exact revenge" which forces the player into the Emergency version of Beside The Battlefield.
- The Silent Champ: "Raise your spearhead!" which forces the player into the Emergency version of Illusory Heist.

In the Decision in Despair node, Talons unlocks you the option:  "Follow the Lich's wisdom" which gives the Chitinous Ripper collectible at the cost of 4 Life Points.

In the encounter Future Hunter, Talons "Present the spearhead representing hatred" which gives an Elite Logistics Rations Voucher (promote an operator without needing to spend hope) in exchange for losing Talons.

At a Lost and Found node, if you exchange away Talons of Hatred you receive Doodle of Hope.

*IS5*

![collectible](https://i.imgur.com/VkYsoyB.png)

*Originium Ingots +10, Wish Fulfilled will appear more often when refreshing nodes; triggers wondrous effects in Wish Fulfilled.*

Lamp of Wishes has about a 50% chance of rerolling a node into a Wish Fulfilled.

In wish nodes an extra option will appear, guaranteeing a specific relic if the conditions are met in the following order:

1. If you have recruited a 6* operator of a branch and you DO NOT have the corresponding Hand Relic, offer that Hand Relic. If you have more than one 6* operator with different branches the order is as it follows:
  1. Hand of Rumble
  2. Hand of Protraction
  3. Hand of Mystery
  4. Hand of Fireworks
  5. Hand of Undulation
  6. Hand of Buckler
  7. Hand of Predation
  8. Hand of Rending
2. If you have a Hand that has a Book of the same name, and having recruited a 5 star/6 star of the corresponding branch but you DO NOT have a book of the same name, offer a book with the same name. Example: Hand of Protraction -> Rusted Blade - Protraction. If you have more than one 5 star/6 star operator with different branches the order is as it follows:
  1. Rusted Blade - Protraction
  2. Broken Wand - Undulation
  3. Blunt Claws - Predation
  4. Bend Spears - Rending
3. If you have >=150 ingots and you DO NOT have Golden Chalice, offer Golden Chalice.

  1. King's New Lance
  2. King's Crown
  3. King's Armor
  4. King's Legacy
6. If you have Visage of Crowned Fates and are at full LP and you DO NOT have the Sarkaz King set, offer a Sarkaz's King relic. In the order that follows:
  1. Sarkaz King's Regal Rest

# Secrets of Terra
- **'Beauty and Ugliness in the Age of Terra'**
*IS2*

![collectible](https://i.imgur.com/Cvofa0t.png)

*For one time only during any battle prior to the final battle of the area, gain 10 Life Points and continue onto the next step instead of concluding the exploration upon mission failure.*

When triggering its effect, your current life total is preserved, your run loss is averted, and you regain 10 life points. If you lost by running out of lives, this means you will have 10 life points again. In contrast, if you have 12 life points on a run, and you use Beauty and Ugliness to instantly quit out on a non-boss stage, you will then have 22 life points. If you know you are going to trigger Beauty and Ugliness on a stage, it is best to trigger it by immediately quitting out (or doing so right before you leak your first enemy), in order to preserve your life total.

- **'End of Times'**
*IS2/IS3/IS4*

![collectible](https://i.imgur.com/vQfR5dR.png)

*For one time only during any battle prior to the final battle of the area, gain 1 Life Point and continue onto the next step instead of concluding the exploration upon mission failure.*

When triggering the End of Times effect, your current life total is preserved, your run loss is averted, and you regain one life point. You do not receive the rewards that you would get if you win the fight (voucher, ingots etc.). If you lost by running out of lives, this means you will have 1 life point again. In contrast, if you have 10/12 life points on an IS3 run, and you use End of Times to instantly quit out on a non-boss stage, you will then have 11/12 life points. If you know you are going to trigger End of Times on a stage, it is best to trigger it by immediately quitting out (or doing so right before you leak your first enemy), in order to preserve your life total.

End of Times will fail to trigger if you lose on a combat that is the last node of each floor, even if it isn't the F3/F5/F6/F7 boss combat. This is only relevant in IS4 if you use a foldartal to reroll the f1 shop or f2/f4 wish fulfilled node into a combat, and is not relevant in either IS2 or IS3.

[Having End of Times and quitting out of a store rob combat will put you back in the store with all the items now free.](<https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Kz4y147qu/>)

- **Fosterer Genotype**
*IS3*

![collectible](https://i.imgur.com/FdCIxsd.png)

*An Operator with Rejection will assimilate 2 nearby normal Operators. When assimilation is complete, the Operator with Rejection temporarily gains [Evolution]: Rejection has no effect, gains 35% Sanctuary, attacks ignore 35% RES and DEF.*

The effects of assimilation last for the stage it is triggered on only, it does not persist between different stages.

Operators that have assimilated a rejection cannot further spread the rejection. The effects of assimilation persist through retreats and redeploys; once an operator has assimilated a rejection in a given stage, there is no way to get rid of that rejection within that stage.

If you want to evolve an operator (say Mlynar) with a (natural) rejection, the two assimilated operators do not have to be in the 8 surrounding tiles of Mlynar at the same time, they can be placed within the vicinity of Mlynar sequentially, and Mlynar will become evolved after the 2nd operator has assimilated his rejection. Mlynar's evolution progress will also be saved between deployments. If Mlynar assimilates 1 operator, then is retreated, then redeployed, then assimilates another operator, he will become evolved.

At D17, when rejections become combined rejections, the method of calculating operator redeployment times changes. At D15 and below, 2-star Yato with Metastatic Aberration has a redeployment time of (65 seconds\*50%)-30 seconds = 2 seconds (rounded down), but with Metastatic Aberration in the form of a combined rejection, she has a (65-30)\*50% = 17.5 seconds (unusually not rounded here) redeployment time. This applies to both natural rejections, and rejections obtained through assimilation. At specifically D16, for some reason, Metastatic Aberration (regardless of whether it is natural or assimilated) provides a -50% redeployment reduction still, but does not reduce operator stats. 

Operators that gain Neurodegeneration from assimilating it will be frozen for the 15 seconds after they've gained the rejection, even if they've been deployed for longer than that.

A single operator can count towards assimilating the rejections of multiple operators, by deploying them on a tile where they are within the 8 surrounding tiles of both operators.


- **Arch Glyph**
*IS5*

![collectible](https://i.imgur.com/2em05vg.png)

*For one time only, if you would fail any battle other than the final battle of the area or a Leader battle and are currently not in a Bizarre Fragment, you will enter a special Bizarre Fragment.*

When triggering the Arch Glyph effect, your current life total is preserved, your run loss is averted, and you regain one life point. You do not receive the rewards that you would get if you win the fight (voucher, ingots etc.). If you lost by running out of lives, this means you will have 1 life point again. In contrast, if you have 10/12 life points on an IS5 run, and you use Arch Glyph to instantly quit out on a non-boss stage, you will then have 11/12 life points. If you know you are going to trigger Arch Glyph on a stage, it is best to trigger it by immediately quitting out (or doing so right before you leak your first enemy), in order to preserve your life total.

Arch Glyph will not save your run if you lose on a combat that is the last node of each floor, even if it isn't a boss combat. In IS5 this is only relevant if you reroll the F1 shop into a combat and lose to it, or on the last node of a Bizarre Fragment.

Arch Glyph will trigger if you quit out while in a Face-Off node despite the fact that quitting out in a Face-Off node doesn't actually lose you the run.

As long as you are in a non-boss/non-last node combat, the "save your run" effect of Arch Glyph will always trigger, while the "enter a Bizarre Fragment" effect will only trigger if you aren't already in a Bizarre Fragment. If you trigger Arch Glyph while already in a Bizarre Fragment on a node that isn't its last node, Arch Glyph will save your run, but not put you into another Bizarre Fragment. (If you lose on a combat that is the last node of a Bizarre Fragment, it will not save your run at all).

If Arch Glyph is triggered while still inside a node (such as through robbing a store), the subsequent effects of that node will be resolved (for instance, you would be able to loot the shop) before you are brought to the Bizarre Fragment. (Like usual, you will not be able to receive the standard clear rewards for that combat.)

If you use the Witchcraft thought to summon a portal, kill the portal, have the portal take away an operator, then quit out before the stage ends (even if the portal is the last enemy, you'll always have at least a few frames to quit out before the stage ends) [the operator taken by the portal will immediately return in the Arch Glyph Bizarre Fragment.](<https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV184421Z7XG/>) On the other hand, killing the Window summoned by Grand Wish, then popping Arch Glyph will not put you in the Epoch of Prosperity. Any damage dealt to the to the Finale Cadence (or killing it) will not properly be carried over if you end the stage by popping Arch Glyph.

The Bizarre Fragment Arch Glyph brings you into always has the following layout. The encounter will always be the encounter "Warm and Cozy," at which you have the option to restore all your life points, or immediately leave:


![collectible](https://i.imgur.com/pW9VCU3.png)


The IS5 5th ending collectible "Reality of the End" brings you to a special Bizarre Fragment that inevitably ends with the run's loss if you fail any stage. If you have both Arch Glyph and "Reality of the End," the one that you obtained first is the one that triggers first. This means that if you obtained Arch Glyph after already obtaining "Reality of the End," Arch Glyph cannot save you.

- **HR Bronze Seal** and **Doctor Silver Seal**
*IS3/IS5*

![collectible](https://i.imgur.com/VVfkPMp.png)

*Recruit a random 5-star Operator that is automatically Promoted.*

![collectible](https://i.imgur.com/S3oqfze.png)

*Recruit a random 6-star Operator that is automatically Promoted.*

You can reject the free operator offered to you (and in fact you should do so a good portion of the time if you're playing Lamp of Wishes in IS5.)

In IS5, if you are playing a class squad, and have not utilized your "first operator of 2 specific classes gets pre-promoted" opportunity (such as by having borrowed a support unit), taking a free operator from bronze/silver seal of one of the pre-promoted classes will waste your free pre-promote opportunity.


# Cursed-related Collectibles
- **Victoria Crown**
*IS2*

![collectible](https://i.imgur.com/uxJJr3D.png)

*All enemy units have +30% ATK, DEF, and Max HP; Boss units gain an additional +15% ATK, +15% DEF, and +30% Max HP.*

The stat modifier effects that apply to all enemies and the stat modifier effects that apply to boss enemies are multiplicative with each other.

- **Half-Refined Diamond**
*IS2*

![collectible](https://i.imgur.com/7N1PBns.png)

*All enemy units have +25% ATK, DEF, and Max HP; Gain -50% Command EXP from battles.*

Effects that provide +EXP% and / or -EXP% are multiplicative with each other.

- **'Endless Life'**
*IS3*

![collectible](https://i.imgur.com/tTqEyn1.png)

*Afflicts a random Operator with a Rejection at the start of each new floor.*

This grants a rejection on the floor you receive it.

- **Wrankwood Safety Suit** and **'Flashing Swords'**
*IS3*

![collectible](https://i.imgur.com/UGx0GlQ.png)

*For each Cursed Curio you have, all allied units gain DEF +25%, RES +10.*

![collectible](https://i.imgur.com/9ppGjXV.png)

*For each Cursed Curio you have, all allied units gain ASPD +35.*

Cursed Curios include both the collectibles you get from F3 at D2 and above, and also ending-related collectibles with negative effects with the exception of Hesitation (so Bishop's Research, Caerula Animus, Caerula Memory, and Caerula Arbor are Cursed Curios).

- **Gul'dul's Silence**
*IS5*

![collectible](https://i.imgur.com/crQqXtY.png)

*All enemies gain +3000 DEF, but lose 100 DEF upon taking damage (Stacks up to 30 times).*

This is applied additively after EM buffs but before any external DEF multipliers.

- **Balor'sa a's Arrogance**
*IS5*

![collectible](https://i.imgur.com/9OtMeV1.png)

*Elite and Leader enemies gain +20% HP, DEF, and ATK.*

This is multiplicative with other enemies' external multipliers as usual.

- **Yli≈°'s Ravings**
*IS5*

![collectible](https://i.imgur.com/ACgFAX7.png)

*All Operators start with -20 SP.*

The sum of all positive and negative SP on deployment effects is calculated before the result is applied to the operator, so the order in which relics that affect SP on deployment are obtained does not matter. 

- **Shard of the Untold Kings**
*IS5*

![collectible](https://i.imgur.com/wyWC1GG.png)

*Loadbearing Operators have -30% ATK.*

The ATK reduction counts as an internal debuff instead of external as one intuitively would think.

# Ending-related Relics
- **Caerula Animus**
*IS3*

![collectible](https://i.imgur.com/AdQNx8f.png)

*-50 Light; when obtained, immediately afflicts a random Operator with a Rejection, and leads the exploration toward a different ending.*

The game never mentions this anywhere, but you need at least 20 light to be able to get the encounter that gives you this.

- **'Last Refrain'**
*IS3*

![collectible](https://i.imgur.com/lVTEizc.png)

*When obtained, randomly gain 2 Revelations.*

The encounter for this collectible can only appear if you are on the path to 3rd Ending (as in: you have the Caerula Animus).

- **Routeweave Net**
*IS4*

![collectible](https://i.imgur.com/gYAjA61.png)

*Additional enemies appear in battle; leads expedition in a different direction.*

Consult tomimi.dev for Routeweave Net additional enemies.
If you take Routeweave Net from a F4 scout, and are also angling for 2nd Ending, there is a chance (around 1/3rd in my experience) that the Prophecy node where you are supposed to take Boundless Gift overwrites the Prophecy node where you decide between 1st and 2nd ending, meaning you will not be able to simultaneously do 2nd and 3rd ending.

- **Horizon Invitation**
*IS4*

![collectible](https://i.imgur.com/sjeIqGr.png)

*Leads expedition in a different direction.*

Before you have purchased it, this collectible will almost always appear in the shop (either on the first page, or after you've rerolled.)

Obtaining this collectible gives you a very high, but not 100%, chance of the next encounter of being the "Chance" encounter, in which you can fight the stage "Illusions in the Sand" for the Dimensional Fluid for 4th Ending. Note that Bosky encounters are exempt from this, you can never get the Chance encounter from Bosky encounters.

If you don't actually care about 4th ending, and are playing a starter that can handle it, you can take Horizon Invitation from the F1 shop, and then fight Illusions in the Sand at the next encounter you get, getting you a good amount of early experience/a voucher, and then just skip Dimensional Fluid. This provides a good amount of early tempo and frees up a shop slot for the remainder of the run.

- **Dimensional Fluid**
*IS4*

![collectible](https://i.imgur.com/EJ0V6Q1.png)

*Leads expedition in a different direction.*

After completing an ending fight, this collectible forces you onto the floor "Dust of Eternity," where you fight the 4th ending boss. This is true even if you already have Boundless Gift and are fighting either ending 1 or 2, completing either will skip over the 3rd ending/Clairvoyant Carcass and force you into 4th ending. If you want to do 3rd and 4th Ending in a single run, you need to take Dimensional Fluid specifically on F6 Clairvoyant Carcass.

- **Amma's Affection**
*IS4*

![collectible](https://i.imgur.com/wBvkHIc.png)

*All allied units gain +1% HP, ATK, and DEF; occasionally something wonderful will happen.*

The "occasionally something wonderful will happen" effect refers to the fact that it unlocks a few special options in a few specific encounters that involve exchanging it away for some additional benefit.

In the On-site at Public Nomadic Station N6 encounter (the one that gives you a free collectible, not the one that gives you a recruit): you can exchange it away for 2 collectibles (instead of the default 1 collectible).

In the Regular Maintenance encounter: you can exchange it away for 15 hope (instead of the default 2/4 hope).

In the Unfreezing River encounter: you can exchange it away for 1 collectible (instead of being forced to take a penalty).

Additionally, in the Reconstruction prophecy node: you can trade it in to skip any one of the 3 requirements you must past for 4th ending.

- **Fragment of Space**
*IS4*

![collectible](https://i.imgur.com/XowZhfL.png)

*-4 Squad Size Limit.*

The way +squad size (and -squad size) collectibles work is they grant the effect only on pickup. After that, the +squad size collectible effect has no further effect. This means that if you take a bunch of +squad size collectibles, overshooting the 13 squad size hard cap, and then take Fragment of Space, you will be brought back down to 9 squad size anyway.

- **Profound Scorchmarks**
*IS4*

![collectible](https://i.imgur.com/MAHshoO.png)

*-12 Max Life Point.*

Deliberately taking this is a reasonably good way of activating King's collectibles in IS4.

- **Ten Rings**
*IS5*

![collectible](https://i.imgur.com/gbeGQk7.png)

*Shadows of the Lord -50% Max HP.*

The encounter for this collectible is only obtainable if you have the Pledge of Babel.

- **Prophet Horn**
*IS5*

![collectible](https://i.imgur.com/riLxnan.png)

*Nodes will turn into Prophecy when refreshed; not active in Bizarre Fragments.*

The Prophet Horn reroll only works once. If you are playing the ingots squad, and haven't used your "reroll a node into a shop for free once on each floor" use yet, rerolling a node will reroll it into a shop, then the next rerolled node on the same floor will be the special Bizarre Fragment prophecy.

- **Petal**
*IS5*

![collectible](https://i.imgur.com/onODpZx.png)

*-50% Command EXP and Originium Ingots from battles; triggers wondrous effects in Face-Off.*

After obtaining this relic Face-Offs will have an additional option "Toss the lotus petal into the tale", in which 2 plans can be expended for the boats fight. This option will be available to attempt the fight an unlimited number of times until it is completed, even after failing it.

- **Anasa's Karma**
*IS5*

![collectible](https://i.imgur.com/2s67o8R.png)

*Leader and Elite enemies have +50% max HP; Dreadful Foes in Border of Truth will be more difficult; leads expedition in a different direction.*

While this relic adds a 50% bonus HP modifier to Elite and Leader enemies, the relic also converts Emergency Lecture, Court Visit, Cognitive Correction and The Court of Souls to emergency versions, applying the following effects:
- Emergency Lecture and Cognitive Correction: Redeployment time buff removed, all enemy units have +30% ATK, DEF, HP and Padmasana of Rebirth appears.
- Court Visit and The Court of Souls: All enemy units have +25% ATK, DEF, HP and Padmasana of Rebirth appears.
