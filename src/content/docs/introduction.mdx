## IS Central
IS Central is a discord community formed by a number of highly skilled IS players who wanted to improve the exposure of high-level IS gameplay to the EN community and to improve the overall quality of EN IS players to be on par with CN. Since its establishment, many experienced players have joined to pool their expert knowledge. A number of these players have played in multiple international tournaments, such as LTA Disjoint 1 and 2, Skywalking Global League IS3 and IS4 edition, EBA tournaments, and IS Bingo Lockout, to name a few. Their participation in these events is a testament to their mental fortitude and experience in playing IS under high-pressure, stressful environments, while still being able to perform optimal play, both inside and outside stages. These players are more than happy to share their expertise to newer players, so please do not be shy to ask them questions. Beyond that, the goal of IS Central is to provide a centralized space and community for people who are interested in playing and getting better at IS, regardless of what your current skill level is.

### You
We welcome you to the IS central. You are now part of a community of EN IS enthusiasts. We welcome people of all backgrounds, experience levels, and goals. Maybe you are a casual player just trying to push your way to D15 in IS5, or a player who has completed D15 and wants to be more consistent with endings, or you are sick of your current SilverAsh starter and want to learn something new. Regardless, we are all here to learn from each other. 

## Tournament-oriented IS
Every few months, a big IS tournament is hosted in which players get the chance to participate and showcase their gameplay. These tournaments typically have a pre-established set of rules that force the player to play at max difficulty and incentivizes them to complete hardest endings within a single run. Moreover, the rules generally allow the player to prepare a start for the run, or reroll certain bad starting RNG outcomes. This mitigates some unavoidable losses due to bad starting RNG, such as not getting a specific F3 buff, a pre-promoted operator, or a specific ending related or essential encounter (such as Fated Encounter in IS5). Many guides in our resource section are tournament-oriented, meaning they will assume tournament conditions, which are widely accepted by the community as fair reasons to reset a run. However, even if you don't want to become a tournament-level player, you'll still be able to find something useful out of these guides. While a more casual player playing at lower difficulties or not aiming for multiple endings might not want to constantly reset to get a tournament-standardized start, lower difficulties are also less punishing, and resetting for an optimal start generally isn't necessary either.

### Casters
Global IS tournaments are staffed by casters who provide live commentary to the gameplay. When watching live broadcasts or recorded VODs of these competitions, it is likely that a new player may fail to fully understand some of the decision-making or plays made by the live competitor. The goal of the caster is to bridge this discrepancy in information. Watching commentated IS live events is an entertaining yet easy way to consume high quality IS gameplay while also gaining insight on the playerâ€™s actions and thought process. 


## Resources
### Stage analyses
Multiple experienced players have contributed into writing both general stage analyses and more in-depth squad-specialized clear strategies. These resources help provide the knowledge necessary to clear a variety of stages, and easing your way through a run and helping you learn faster.

### Playlists
Our squad guides and our discord server contain playlists that showcase standardized references for a large number of IS stages. A playlist guide is essentially a set of an example clear for each relevant stage using a particular starting character (in conjunction with common other picks with that starter.) \
These playlists are useful, both as something that can often be directly copied, but also as a source of specific timings/skill cycles, placements and approaches to the stage that can be incorporated into your own strategies. \
Some of these playlists have an introduction section describing the common drafted operators paired with said starting character, or possible synergies.\
These videos should, as always, be used as a reference. Oftentimes the exact conditions shown in the video are not replicated and hence caution/adaptation is necessary. 

### Tomimi.dev
<a href="https://tomimi.dev/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tomimi.dev</a> is a dedicated website built by CN players for IS maps. The website is structured into different IS themes, with each dedicated page for each map. Here are a number of functions that tomimi.dev provides:
* Enemy stat calculation, with the ability to account for difficulty multipliers, collectibles, stage modifiers and other conditional effects (for example, epochs)
* Enemy spawn timing and pathing simulator
* Enemy spawn permutations
* Number of enemies that signal a hidden enemy is present
* Emergency stage conditions
* Numbers and probabilities for various stage drops 
* One click buttons to search up video references of a given stage

### Map.arknights
<a href="https://map.ark-nights.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Map.arknights</a> is another website that functions similar to tomimi.dev, but instead has a wider scope, containing all maps in Arknights. The main advantage of map.arknights is the ability to select and deploy operators on a pseudo-map containing coordinates, allowing the player to communicate operator placements with others. Most other aspects of map.arknights in the context of IS are subpar compared to tomimi.dev
### A certain three letter application
There are other applications made for emulator users to automate certain IS procedures such as farming for ingot investment balance, starting bonuses or initial promoted operators. The stance of the writer is neutral to the use of these third-party applications, despite how convenient and widespread its use has become. 	

## FAQ
* I'm new to IS, where do I start?\
Our [Getting Started](/getting-started/) guide explains all the fundamentals of IS a new player should start getting familiarized with and gives an insight into what top IS gameplay is like.

* The guides here seem to be focused for max difficulty with the hardest endings but I'm more of a casual player, is there anything for me?\
Yes, many guides are written aiming for players doing the hardest clears, these will explain how to deal with stages at the worst possible conditions, however, that doesn't mean they are useless to you, the strategies will generally work at lower difficulties, they will have more room for error and operators may be more easily replaced. 

* I can't find what I need to clear x stage, what do I do?\
If our stage guides don't provide what you are looking for you can always join our <a href="https://discord.gg/fqRBzQWVfK" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">discord</a> and ask more experienced players there. Don't be afraid to ask even if you are at the lowest difficulty or you are only a new player.

* I have been playing IS for a while and I want to take it to the next level, what do I do?\
There is only so much we can teach through guides, each player's skills will also develop through constant practice. You can join our discord and interact with fellow players that share your interests and are happy to help each other. We also act as a central space for announcements and notifications of IS tournaments, which are where every player showcases the results of their practice. Watching and participating in tournaments is a good way to push yourself into further improving your own IS skills.

* How can I contribute?\
You can help our web development team, which you can contribute to by helping format and publish guides other people write, or alternatively by writing guides yourself if you have the necessary knowledge. If you have a personal playstyle or operator core or approach to a given stage or ending that you would like to share, we would greatly appreciate a guide documenting this. If you have knowledge on website development, your insights would also be greatly appreciated. The first step is checking out our [contribute guide](/contribute/).



{/**
Ideally we can add a high level overview for each IS as well as a few links going out of it to specific key guides we want to mention

Ie it may be practical to include the meta squads and starts for eahc IS, as well as a link to boss specific guides
