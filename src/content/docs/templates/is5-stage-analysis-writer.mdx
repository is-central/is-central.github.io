Below is markdown (md) for a template IS5 strategy section for writers. If you are proposing a page via the discord, you should format it as below. You are also welcome to format it directly as on the website (see our <a href="https://is-central.github.io/contribute/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">website contribution guide</a>). Documents for the discord should be formatted as a markdown (.md) file.
